whatever hour you woke there was a door shutting from room to room they went hand in hand lifting here opening there making surea ghostly couple,1
here we left it she said and he added oh but here too its upstairs she murmured and in the garden he whispered quietly they said or we shall wake them,1
but it wasnt that you woke us oh no theyre looking for it theyre drawing the curtain one might say and so read on a page or two now theyve found it one would be certain stopping the pencil on the margin and then tired of reading one might rise and see for oneself the house all empty the doors standing open only the wood pigeons bubbling with content and the hum of the threshing machine sounding from the farm what did i come in here for what did i want to find my hands were empty perhaps its upstairs then the apples were in the loft and so down again the garden still as ever only the book had slipped into the grass,1
but they had found it in the drawing room not that one could ever see them the window panes reflected apples reflected roses all the leaves were green in the glass if they moved in the drawing room the apple only turned its yellow side yet the moment after if the door was opened spread about the floor hung upon the walls pendant from the ceilingwhat my hands were empty the shadow of a thrush crossed the carpet from the deepest wells of silence the wood pigeon drew its bubble of sound safe safe safe the pulse of the house beat softly the treasure buried the room the pulse stopped short oh was that the buried treasure,1
a moment later the light had faded out in the garden then but the trees spun darkness for a wandering beam of sun so fine so rare coolly sunk beneath the surface the beam i sought always burnt behind the glass death was the glass death was between us coming to the woman first hundreds of years ago leaving the house sealing all the windows the rooms were darkened he left it left her went north went east saw the stars turned in the southern sky sought the house found it dropped beneath the downs safe safe safe the pulse of the house beat gladly the treasure yours,1
the wind roars up the avenue trees stoop and bend this way and that moonbeams splash and spill wildly in the rain but the beam of the lamp falls straight from the window the candle burns stiff and still wandering through the house opening the windows whispering not to wake us the ghostly couple seek their joy,1
here we slept she says and he adds kisses without number waking in the morning silver between the trees upstairs in the garden when summer came in winter snowtime the doors go shutting far in the distance gently knocking like the pulse of a heart,1
nearer they come cease at the doorway the wind falls the rain slides silver down the glass our eyes darken we hear no steps beside us we see no lady spread her ghostly cloak his hands shield the lantern look he breathes sound asleep love upon their lips,1
stooping holding their silver lamp above us long they look and deeply long they pause the wind drives straightly the flame stoops slightly wild beams of moonlight cross both floor and wall and meeting stain the faces bent the faces pondering the faces that search the sleepers and seek their hidden joy,1
safe safe safe the heart of the house beats proudly long years he sighs again you found me here she murmurs sleeping in the garden reading laughing rolling apples in the loft here we left our treasure stooping their light lifts the lids upon my eyes safe safe safe the pulse of the house beats wildly waking i cry oh is this your buried treasure the light in the heart,1
this is how it all came about six or seven of us were sitting one day after tea some were gazing across the street into the windows of a milliners shop where the light still shone brightly upon scarlet feathers and golden slippers others were idly occupied in building little towers of sugar upon the edge of the tea tray after a time so far as i can remember we drew round the fire and began as usual to praise menhow strong how noble how brilliant how courageous how beautiful they werehow we envied those who by hook or by crook managed to get attached to one for lifewhen poll who had said nothing burst into tears poll i must tell you has always been queer for one thing her father was a strange man he left her a fortune in his will but on condition that she read all the books in the london library we comforted her as best we could but we knew in our hearts how vain it was for though we like her poll is no beauty leaves her shoe laces untied and must have been thinking while we praised men that not one of them would ever wish to marry her at last she dried her tears for some time we could make nothing of what she said strange enough it was in all conscience she told us that as we knew she spent most of her time in the london library reading she had begun she said with english literature on the top floor and was steadily working her way down to the times on the bottom and now half or perhaps only a quarter way through a terrible thing had happened she could read no more books were not what we thought them books she cried rising to her feet and speaking with an intensity of desolation which i shall never forget are for the most part unutterably bad,1
of course we cried out that shakespeare wrote books and milton and shelley,1
oh yes she interrupted us youve been well taught i can see but you are not members of the london library here her sobs broke forth anew at length recovering a little she opened one of the pile of books which she always carried about with herfrom a window or in a garden or some such name as that it was called and it was written by a man called benton or henson or something of that kind she read the first few pages we listened in silence but thats not a book someone said so she chose another this time it was a history but i have forgotten the writers name our trepidation increased as she went on not a word of it seemed to be true and the style in which it was written was execrable,1
poetry poetry we cried impatiently read us poetry i cannot describe the desolation which fell upon us as she opened a little volume and mouthed out the verbose sentimental foolery which it contained,1
it must have been written by a woman one of us urged but no she told us that it was written by a young man one of the most famous poets of the day i leave you to imagine what the shock of the discovery was though we all cried and begged her to read no more she persisted and read us extracts from the lives of the lord chancellors when she had finished jane the eldest and wisest of us rose to her feet and said that she for one was not convinced,1
why she asked if men write such rubbish as this should our mothers have wasted their youth in bringing them into the world,1
we were all silent and in the silence poor poll could be heard sobbing out why why did my father teach me to read,1
clorinda was the first to come to her senses its all our fault she said every one of us knows how to read but no one save poll has ever taken the trouble to do it i for one have taken it for granted that it was a womans duty to spend her youth in bearing children i venerated my mother for bearing ten still more my grandmother for bearing fifteen it was i confess my own ambition to bear twenty we have gone on all these ages supposing that men were equally industrious and that their works were of equal merit while we have borne the children they we supposed have borne the books and the pictures we have populated the world they have civilized it but now that we can read what prevents us from judging the results before we bring another child into the world we must swear that we will find out what the world is like,1
so we made ourselves into a society for asking questions one of us was to visit a manofwar another was to hide herself in a scholars study another was to attend a meeting of business men while all were to read books look at pictures go to concerts keep our eyes open in the streets and ask questions perpetually we were very young you can judge of our simplicity when i tell you that before parting that night we agreed that the objects of life were to produce good people and good books our questions were to be directed to finding out how far these objects were now attained by men we vowed solemnly that we would not bear a single child until we were satisfied,1
off we went then some to the british museum others to the kings navy some to oxford others to cambridge we visited the royal academy and the tate heard modern music in concert rooms went to the law courts and saw new plays no one dined out without asking her partner certain questions and carefully noting his replies at intervals we met together and compared our observations oh those were merry meetings never have i laughed so much as i did when rose read her notes upon honour and described how she had dressed herself as an thiopian prince and gone aboard one of his majestys ships discovering the hoax the captain visited her now disguised as a private gentleman and demanded that honour should be satisfied but how she asked how he bellowed with the cane of course seeing that he was beside himself with rage and expecting that her last moment had come she bent over and received to her amazement six light taps upon the behind the honour of the british navy is avenged he cried and raising herself she saw him with the sweat pouring down his face holding out a trembling right hand away she exclaimed striking an attitude and imitating the ferocity of his own expression my honour has still to be satisfied spoken like a gentleman he returned and fell into profound thought if six strokes avenge the honour of the kings navy he mused how many avenge the honour of a private gentleman he said he would prefer to lay the case before his brother officers she replied haughtily that she could not wait he praised her sensibility let me see he cried suddenly did your father keep a carriage no she said or a riding horse we had a donkey she bethought her which drew the mowing machine at this his face lighted my mothers name she added for gods sake man dont mention your mothers name he shrieked trembling like an aspen and flushing to the roots of his hair and it was ten minutes at least before she could induce him to proceed at length he decreed that if she gave him four strokes and a half in the small of the back at a spot indicated by himself the half conceded he said in recognition of the fact that her great grandmothers uncle was killed at trafalgar it was his opinion that her honour would be as good as new this was done they retired to a restaurant drank two bottles of wine for which he insisted upon paying and parted with protestations of eternal friendship,1
then we had fannys account of her visit to the law courts at her first visit she had come to the conclusion that the judges were either made of wood or were impersonated by large animals resembling man who had been trained to move with extreme dignity mumble and nod their heads to test her theory she had liberated a handkerchief of bluebottles at the critical moment of a trial but was unable to judge whether the creatures gave signs of humanity for the buzzing of the flies induced so sound a sleep that she only woke in time to see the prisoners led into the cells below but from the evidence she brought we voted that it is unfair to suppose that the judges are men,1
helen went to the royal academy but when asked to deliver her report upon the pictures she began to recite from a pale blue volume o for the touch of a vanished hand and the sound of a voice that is still home is the hunter home from the hill he gave his bridle reins a shake love is sweet love is brief spring the fair spring is the years pleasant king o to be in england now that aprils there men must work and women must weep the path of duty is the way to glory we could listen to no more of this gibberish,1
daughters of england she began but here we pulled her down a vase of water getting spilt over her in the scuffle,1
thank god she exclaimed shaking herself like a dog now ill roll on the carpet and see if i cant brush off what remains of the union jack then perhaps here she rolled energetically getting up she began to explain to us what modern pictures are like when castalia stopped her,1
what is the average size of a picture she asked perhaps two feet by two and a half she said castalia made notes while helen spoke and when she had done and we were trying not to meet each others eyes rose and said at your wish i spent last week at oxbridge disguised as a charwoman i thus had access to the rooms of several professors and will now attempt to give you some ideaonly she broke off i cant think how to do it its all so queer these professors she went on live in large houses built round grass plots each in a kind of cell by himself yet they have every convenience and comfort you have only to press a button or light a little lamp their papers are beautifully filed books abound there are no children or animals save half a dozen stray cats and one aged bullfincha cock i remember she broke off an aunt of mine who lived at dulwich and kept cactuses you reached the conservatory through the double drawingroom and there on the hot pipes were dozens of them ugly squat bristly little plants each in a separate pot once in a hundred years the aloe flowered so my aunt said but she died before that happened we told her to keep to the point well she resumed when professor hobkin was out i examined his life work an edition of sappho its a queer looking book six or seven inches thick not all by sappho oh no most of it is a defence of sapphos chastity which some german had denied and i can assure you the passion with which these two gentlemen argued the learning they displayed the prodigious ingenuity with which they disputed the use of some implement which looked to me for all the world like a hairpin astounded me especially when the door opened and professor hobkin himself appeared a very nice mild old gentleman but what could he know about chastity we misunderstood her,1
no no she protested hes the soul of honour im surenot that he resembles roses sea captain in the least i was thinking rather of my aunts cactuses what could they know about chastity,1
again we told her not to wander from the pointdid the oxbridge professors help to produce good people and good booksthe objects of life,1
there she exclaimed it never struck me to ask it never occurred to me that they could possibly produce anything,1
i believe said sue that you made some mistake probably professor hobkin was a gyncologist a scholar is a very different sort of man a scholar is overflowing with humour and inventionperhaps addicted to wine but what of thata delightful companion generous subtle imaginativeas stands to reason for he spends his life in company with the finest human beings that have ever existed,1
hum said castalia perhaps id better go back and try again,1
some three months later it happened that i was sitting alone when castalia entered i dont know what it was in the look of her that so moved me but i could not restrain myself and dashing across the room i clasped her in my arms not only was she very beautiful she seemed also in the highest spirits how happy you look i exclaimed as she sat down,1
you have not broken our vow i said anxiously noticing something about her figure,1
oh the vow she said casually im going to have a baby if thats what you mean you cant imagine she burst out how exciting how beautiful how satisfying,1
totoanswer questions she replied in some confusion whereupon she told me the whole of her story but in the middle of an account which interested and excited me more than anything i had ever heard she gave the strangest cry half whoop half holloa,1
chastity chastity wheres my chastity she cried help ho the scent bottle,1
there was nothing in the room but a cruet containing mustard which i was about to administer when she recovered her composure,1
you should have thought of that three months ago i said severely,1
true she replied theres not much good in thinking of it now it was unfortunate by the way that my mother had me called castalia,1
oh castalia your mother i was beginning when she reached for the mustard pot,1
no no no she said shaking her head if youd been a chaste woman yourself you would have screamed at the sight of meinstead of which you rushed across the room and took me in your arms no cassandra we are neither of us chaste so we went on talking,1
meanwhile the room was filling up for it was the day appointed to discuss the results of our observations everyone i thought felt as i did about castalia they kissed her and said how glad they were to see her again at length when we were all assembled jane rose and said that it was time to begin she began by saying that we had now asked questions for over five years and that though the results were bound to be inconclusivehere castalia nudged me and whispered that she was not so sure about that then she got up and interrupting jane in the middle of a sentence said,1
before you say any more i want to knowam i to stay in the room because she added i have to confess that i am an impure woman,1
it was extraordinary to see the different expressions on their faces a sort of hum went through the room in which i could catch the words impure baby castalia and so on jane who was herself considerably moved put it to us,1
such a roar filled the room as might have been heard in the street outside,1
no no no let her stay impure fiddlesticks yet i fancied that some of the youngest girls of nineteen or twenty held back as if overcome with shyness then we all came about her and began asking questions and at last i saw one of the youngest who had kept in the background approach shyly and say to her,1
what is chastity then i mean is it good or is it bad or is it nothing at all she replied so low that i could not catch what she said,1
you know i was shocked said another for at least ten minutes,1
in my opinion said poll who was growing crusty from always reading in the london library chastity is nothing but ignorancea most discreditable state of mind we should admit only the unchaste to our society i vote that castalia shall be our president,1
it is as unfair to brand women with chastity as with unchastity said poll some of us havent the opportunity either moreover i dont believe cassy herself maintains that she acted as she did from a pure love of knowledge,1
he is only twentyone and divinely beautiful said cassy with a ravishing gesture,1
i move said helen that no one be allowed to talk of chastity or unchastity save those who are in love,1
oh bother said judith who had been enquiring into scientific matters im not in love and im longing to explain my measures for dispensing with prostitutes and fertilizing virgins by act of parliament,1
she went on to tell us of an invention of hers to be erected at tube stations and other public resorts which upon payment of a small fee would safeguard the nations health accommodate its sons and relieve its daughters then she had contrived a method of preserving in sealed tubes the germs of future lord chancellors or poets or painters or musicians she went on supposing that is to say that these breeds are not extinct and that women still wish to bear children,1
of course we wish to bear children cried castalia impatiently jane rapped the table,1
that is the very point we are met to consider she said for five years we have been trying to find out whether we are justified in continuing the human race castalia has anticipated our decision but it remains for the rest of us to make up our minds,1
here one after another of our messengers rose and delivered their reports the marvels of civilisation far exceeded our expectations and as we learnt for the first time how man flies in the air talks across space penetrates to the heart of an atom and embraces the universe in his speculations a murmur of admiration burst from our lips,1
we are proud we cried that our mothers sacrificed their youth in such a cause as this castalia who had been listening intently looked prouder than all the rest then jane reminded us that we had still much to learn and castalia begged us to make haste on we went through a vast tangle of statistics we learnt that england has a population of so many millions and that such and such a proportion of them is constantly hungry and in prison that the average size of a working mans family is such and that so great a percentage of women die from maladies incident to childbirth reports were read of visits to factories shops slums and dockyards descriptions were given of the stock exchange of a gigantic house of business in the city and of a government office the british colonies were now discussed and some account was given of our rule in india africa and ireland i was sitting by castalia and i noticed her uneasiness,1
we shall never come to any conclusion at all at this rate she said as it appears that civilisation is so much more complex than we had any notion would it not be better to confine ourselves to our original enquiry we agreed that it was the object of life to produce good people and good books all this time we have been talking of aeroplanes factories and money let us talk about men themselves and their arts for that is the heart of the matter,1
so the diners out stepped forward with long slips of paper containing answers to their questions these had been framed after much consideration a good man we had agreed must at any rate be honest passionate and unworldly but whether or not a particular man possessed those qualities could only be discovered by asking questions often beginning at a remote distance from the centre is kensington a nice place to live in where is your son being educatedand your daughter now please tell me what do you pay for your cigars by the way is sir joseph a baronet or only a knight often it seemed that we learnt more from trivial questions of this kind than from more direct ones i accepted my peerage said lord bunkum because my wife wished it i forget how many titles were accepted for the same reason working fifteen hours out of the twentyfour as i do ten thousand professional men began,1
no no of course you can neither read nor write but why do you work so hard my dear lady with a growing family but why does your family grow their wives wished that too or perhaps it was the british empire but more significant than the answers were the refusals to answer very few would reply at all to questions about morality and religion and such answers as were given were not serious questions as to the value of money and power were almost invariably brushed aside or pressed at extreme risk to the asker im sure said jill that if sir harley tightboots hadnt been carving the mutton when i asked him about the capitalist system he would have cut my throat the only reason why we escaped with our lives over and over again is that men are at once so hungry and so chivalrous they despise us too much to mind what we say,1
of course they despise us said eleanor at the same time how do you account for thisi made enquiries among the artists now no woman has ever been an artist has she poll,1
janeaustencharlottebrontgeorgeeliot cried poll like a man crying muffins in a back street,1
damn the woman someone exclaimed what a bore she is,1
since sappho there has been no female of first rate eleanor began quoting from a weekly newspaper,1
its now well known that sappho was the somewhat lewd invention of professor hobkin ruth interrupted,1
anyhow there is no reason to suppose that any woman ever has been able to write or ever will be able to write eleanor continued and yet whenever i go among authors they never cease to talk to me about their books masterly i say or shakespeare himself for one must say something and i assure you they believe me,1
that proves nothing said jane they all do it only she sighed it doesnt seem to help us much perhaps we had better examine modern literature next liz its your turn,1
elizabeth rose and said that in order to prosecute her enquiry she had dressed as a man and been taken for a reviewer,1
i have read new books pretty steadily for the past five years said she mr wells is the most popular living writer then comes mr arnold bennett then mr compton mackenzie mr mckenna and mr walpole may be bracketed together she sat down,1
but youve told us nothing we expostulated or do you mean that these gentlemen have greatly surpassed janeelliot and that english fiction iswheres that review of yours oh yes safe in their hands,1
safe quite safe she said shifting uneasily from foot to foot and im sure that they give away even more than they receive,1
we were all sure of that but we pressed her do they write good books,1
good books she said looking at the ceiling you must remember she began speaking with extreme rapidity that fiction is the mirror of life and you cant deny that education is of the highest importance and that it would be extremely annoying if you found yourself alone at brighton late at night not to know which was the best boarding house to stay at and suppose it was a dripping sunday eveningwouldnt it be nice to go to the movies,1
but what has that got to do with it we asked,1
the truth but isnt it wonderful she broke offmr chitter has written a weekly article for the past thirty years upon love or hot buttered toast and has sent all his sons to eton,1
oh the truth she stammered the truth has nothing to do with literature and sitting down she refused to say another word,1
ladies we must try to sum up the results jane was beginning when a hum which had been heard for some time through the open window drowned her voice,1
war war war declaration of war men were shouting in the street below,1
what war we cried what war we remembered too late that we had never thought of sending anyone to the house of commons we had forgotten all about it we turned to poll who had reached the history shelves in the london library and asked her to enlighten us,1
sometimes for one reason sometimes for another she replied calmly in for example the shouts outside drowned her words again in in it was the austrians in was the francoprussianin on the other hand,1
ah i dont know what theyre going to war for now she admitted,1
the war was over and peace was in process of being signed when i once more found myself with castalia in the room where our meetings used to be held we began idly turning over the pages of our old minute books queer i mused to see what we were thinking five years ago we are agreed castalia quoted reading over my shoulder that it is the object of life to produce good people and good books we made no comment upon that a good man is at any rate honest passionate and unworldly what a womans language i observed oh dear cried castalia pushing the book away from her what fools we were it was all polls fathers fault she went on i believe he did it on purposethat ridiculous will i mean forcing poll to read all the books in the london library if we hadnt learnt to read she said bitterly we might still have been bearing children in ignorance and that i believe was the happiest life after all i know what youre going to say about war she checked me and the horror of bearing children to see them killed but our mothers did it and their mothers and their mothers before them and they didnt complain they couldnt read ive done my best she sighed to prevent my little girl from learning to read but whats the use i caught ann only yesterday with a newspaper in her hand and she was beginning to ask me if it was true next shell ask me whether mr lloyd george is a good man then whether mr arnold bennett is a good novelist and finally whether i believe in god how can i bring my daughter up to believe in nothing she demanded,1
surely you could teach her to believe that a mans intellect is and always will be fundamentally superior to a womans i suggested she brightened at this and began to turn over our old minutes again yes she said think of their discoveries their mathematics their science their philosophy their scholarship and then she began to laugh i shall never forget old hobkin and the hairpin she said and went on reading and laughing and i thought she was quite happy when suddenly she drew the book from her and burst out oh cassandra why do you torment me dont you know that our belief in mans intellect is the greatest fallacy of them all what i exclaimed ask any journalist schoolmaster politician or public house keeper in the land and they will all tell you that men are much cleverer than women as if i doubted it she said scornfully how could they help it havent we bred them and fed and kept them in comfort since the beginning of time so that they may be clever even if theyre nothing else its all our doing she cried we insisted upon having intellect and now weve got it and its intellect she continued thats at the bottom of it what could be more charming than a boy before he has begun to cultivate his intellect he is beautiful to look at he gives himself no airs he understands the meaning of art and literature instinctively he goes about enjoying his life and making other people enjoy theirs then they teach him to cultivate his intellect he becomes a barrister a civil servant a general an author a professor every day he goes to an office every year he produces a book he maintains a whole family by the products of his brainpoor devil soon he cannot come into a room without making us all feel uncomfortable he condescends to every woman he meets and dares not tell the truth even to his own wife instead of rejoicing our eyes we have to shut them if we are to take him in our arms true they console themselves with stars of all shapes ribbons of all shades and incomes of all sizesbut what is to console us that we shall be able in ten years time to spend a weekend at lahore or that the least insect in japan has a name twice the length of its body oh cassandra for heavens sake let us devise a method by which men may bear children it is our only chance for unless we provide them with some innocent occupation we shall get neither good people nor good books we shall perish beneath the fruits of their unbridled activity and not a human being will survive to know that there once was shakespeare,1
it is too late i replied we cannot provide even for the children that we have,1
and then you ask me to believe in intellect she said,1
while we spoke men were crying hoarsely and wearily in the street and listening we heard that the treaty of peace had just been signed the voices died away the rain was falling and interfered no doubt with the proper explosion of the fireworks,1
my cook will have bought the evening news said castalia and ann will be spelling it out over her tea i must go home,1
its no goodnot a bit of good i said once she knows how to read theres only one thing you can teach her to believe inand that is herself,1
so we swept up the papers of our society and though ann was playing with her doll very happily we solemnly made her a present of the lot and told her we had chosen her to be president of the society of the futureupon which she burst into tears poor little girl,1
lazy and indifferent shaking space easily from his wings knowing his way the heron passes over the church beneath the sky white and distant absorbed in itself endlessly the sky covers and uncovers moves and remains a lake blot the shores of it out a mountain oh perfectthe sun gold on its slopes down that falls ferns then or white feathers for ever and ever,1
desiring truth awaiting it laboriously distilling a few words for ever desiringa cry starts to the left another to the right wheels strike divergently omnibuses conglomerate in conflictfor ever desiringthe clock asseverates with twelve distinct strokes that it is midday light sheds gold scales children swarmfor ever desiring truth red is the dome coins hang on the trees smoke trails from the chimneys bark shout cry iron for saleand truth,1

now to recollect by the fireside on the white square of marble from ivory depths words rising shed their blackness blossom and penetrate fallen the book in the flame in the smoke in the momentary sparksor now voyaging the marble square pendant minarets beneath and the indian seas while space rushes blue and stars glinttruth or now content with closeness,1
lazy and indifferent the heron returns the sky veils her stars then bares them,1
such an expression of unhappiness was enough by itself to make ones eyes slide above the papers edge to the poor womans faceinsignificant without that look almost a symbol of human destiny with it lifes what you see in peoples eyes lifes what they learn and having learnt it never though they seek to hide it cease to be aware ofwhat that lifes like that it seems five faces oppositefive mature facesand the knowledge in each face strange though how people want to conceal it marks of reticence are on all those faces lips shut eyes shaded each one of the five doing something to hide or stultify his knowledge one smokes another reads a third checks entries in a pocket book a fourth stares at the map of the line framed opposite and the fifththe terrible thing about the fifth is that she does nothing at all she looks at life ah but my poor unfortunate woman do play the gamedo for all our sakes conceal it,1
as if she heard me she looked up shifted slightly in her seat and sighed she seemed to apologise and at the same time to say to me if only you knew then she looked at life again but i do know i answered silently glancing at the times for manners sake i know the whole business peace between germany and the allied powers was yesterday officially ushered in at parissignor nitti the italian prime ministera passenger train at doncaster was in collision with a goods train we all knowthe times knowsbut we pretend we dont my eyes had once more crept over the papers rim she shuddered twitched her arm queerly to the middle of her back and shook her head again i dipped into my great reservoir of life take what you like i continued births deaths marriages court circular the habits of birds leonardo da vinci the sandhills murder high wages and the cost of livingoh take what you like i repeated its all in the times again with infinite weariness she moved her head from side to side until like a top exhausted with spinning it settled on her neck,1
the times was no protection against such sorrow as hers but other human beings forbade intercourse the best thing to do against life was to fold the paper so that it made a perfect square crisp thick impervious even to life this done i glanced up quickly armed with a shield of my own she pierced through my shield she gazed into my eyes as if searching any sediment of courage at the depths of them and damping it to clay her twitch alone denied all hope discounted all illusion,1
so we rattled through surrey and across the border into sussex but with my eyes upon life i did not see that the other travellers had left one by one till save for the man who read we were alone together here was three bridges station we drew slowly down the platform and stopped was he going to leave us i prayed both waysi prayed last that he might stay at that instant he roused himself crumpled his paper contemptuously like a thing done with burst open the door and left us alone,1
the unhappy woman leaning a little forward palely and colourlessly addressed metalked of stations and holidays of brothers at eastbourne and the time of year which was i forget now early or late but at last looking from the window and seeing i knew only life she breathed staying awaythats the drawback of it ah now we approached the catastrophe my sisterinlawthe bitterness of her tone was like lemon on cold steel and speaking not to me but to herself she muttered nonsense she would saythats what they all say and while she spoke she fidgeted as though the skin on her back were as a plucked fowls in a poulterers shopwindow,1
oh that cow she broke off nervously as though the great wooden cow in the meadow had shocked her and saved her from some indiscretion then she shuddered and then she made the awkward angular movement that i had seen before as if after the spasm some spot between the shoulders burnt or itched then again she looked the most unhappy woman in the world and i once more reproached her though not with the same conviction for if there were a reason and if i knew the reason the stigma was removed from life,1
her lips pursed as if to spit venom at the word pursed they remained all she did was to take her glove and rub hard at a spot on the windowpane she rubbed as if she would rub something out for eversome stain some indelible contamination indeed the spot remained for all her rubbing and back she sank with the shudder and the clutch of the arm i had come to expect something impelled me to take my glove and rub my window there too was a little speck on the glass for all my rubbing it remained and then the spasm went through me i crooked my arm and plucked at the middle of my back my skin too felt like the damp chickens skin in the poulterers shopwindow one spot between the shoulders itched and irritated felt clammy felt raw could i reach it surreptitiously i tried she saw me a smile of infinite irony infinite sorrow flitted and faded from her face but she had communicated shared her secret passed her poison she would speak no more leaning back in my corner shielding my eyes from her eyes seeing only the slopes and hollows greys and purples of the winters landscape i read her message deciphered her secret reading it beneath her gaze,1

thats the mans way thats the sound that reverberates thats st pauls and the motoromnibuses but were brushing the crumbs off oh moggridge you wont stay you must be off are you driving through eastbourne this afternoon in one of those little carriages are you the man whos walled up in green cardboard boxes and sometimes has the blinds down and sometimes sits so solemn staring like a sphinx and always theres a look of the sepulchral something of the undertaker the coffin and the dusk about horse and driver do tell mebut the doors slammed we shall never meet again moggridge farewell,1
yes yes im coming right up to the top of the house one moment ill linger how the mud goes round in the mindwhat a swirl these monsters leave the waters rocking the weeds waving and green here black there striking to the sand till by degrees the atoms reassemble the deposit sifts itself and again through the eyes one sees clear and still and there comes to the lips some prayer for the departed some obsequy for the souls of those one nods to the people one never meets again,1
james moggridge is dead now gone for ever well minniei can face it no longer if she said thatlet me look at her she is brushing the eggshell into deep declivities she said it certainly leaning against the wall of the bedroom and plucking at the little balls which edge the claretcoloured curtain but when the self speaks to the self who is speakingthe entombed soul the spirit driven in in in to the central catacomb the self that took the veil and left the worlda coward perhaps yet somehow beautiful as it flits with its lantern restlessly up and down the dark corridors i can bear it no longer her spirit says that man at lunchhildathe children oh heavens her sob its the spirit wailing its destiny the spirit driven hither thither lodging on the diminishing carpetsmeagre footholdsshrunken shreds of all the vanishing universelove life faith husband children i know not what splendours and pageantries glimpsed in girlhood not for menot for me,1
but thenthe muffins the bald elderly dog bead mats i should fancy and the consolation of underlinen if minnie marsh were run over and taken to hospital nurses and doctors themselves would exclaim theres the vista and the visiontheres the distancethe blue blot at the end of the avenue while after all the tea is rich the muffin hot and the dogbenny to your basket sir and see what mothers brought you so taking the glove with the worn thumb defying once more the encroaching demon of whats called going in holes you renew the fortifications threading the grey wool running it in and out,1
running it in and out across and over spinning a web through which god himselfhush dont think of god how firm the stitches are you must be proud of your darning let nothing disturb her let the light fall gently and the clouds show an inner vest of the first green leaf let the sparrow perch on the twig and shake the raindrop hanging to the twigs elbow why look up was it a sound a thought oh heavens back again to the thing you did the plate glass with the violet loops but hilda will come ignominies humiliations oh close the breach,1
having mended her glove minnie marsh lays it in the drawer she shuts the drawer with decision i catch sight of her face in the glass lips are pursed chin held high next she laces her shoes then she touches her throat whats your brooch mistletoe or merrythought and what is happening unless im much mistaken the pulses quickened the moments coming the threads are racing niagaras ahead heres the crisis heaven be with you down she goes courage courage face it be it for gods sake dont wait on the mat now theres the door im on your side speak confront her confound her soul,1
oh i beg your pardon yes this is eastbourne ill reach it down for you let me try the handle but minnie though we keep up pretences ive read you rightim with you now,1
but why do you look about you hilda wont come to the station nor john and moggridge is driving at the far side of eastbourne,1
ill wait by my bag maam thats safest he said hed meet me oh there he is thats my son,1
well but im confounded surely minnie you know better a strange young man stop ill tell himminniemiss marshi dont know though theres something queer in her cloak as it blows oh but its untrue its indecent look how he bends as they reach the gateway she finds her ticket whats the joke off they go down the road side by side well my worlds done for what do i stand on what do i know thats not minnie there never was moggridge who am i lifes bare as bone,1
and yet the last look of themhe stepping from the kerb and she following him round the edge of the big building brims me with wonderfloods me anew mysterious figures mother and son who are you why do you walk down the street where tonight will you sleep and then tomorrow oh how it whirls and surgesfloats me afresh i start after them people drive this way and that the white light splutters and pours plateglass windows carnations chrysanthemums ivy in dark gardens milk carts at the door wherever i go mysterious figures i see you turning the corner mothers and sons you you you i hasten i follow this i fancy must be the sea grey is the landscape dim as ashes the water murmurs and moves if i fall on my knees if i go through the ritual the ancient antics its you unknown figures you i adore if i open my arms its you i embrace you i draw to meadorable world,1
well here we are and if you cast your eye over the room you will see that tubes and trams and omnibuses private carriages not a few even i venture to believe landaus with bays in them have been busy at it weaving threads from one end of london to the other yet i begin to have my doubts,1
if indeed its true as theyre saying that regent street is up and the treaty signed and the weather not cold for the time of year and even at that rent not a flat to be had and the worst of influenza its after effects if i bethink me of having forgotten to write about the leak in the larder and left my glove in the train if the ties of blood require me leaning forward to accept cordially the hand which is perhaps offered hesitatingly,1
well the late afternoon suits me the best though if it werent asking too much,1
if the minds shot through by such little arrows andfor human society compels itno sooner is one launched than another presses forward if this engenders heat and in addition theyve turned on the electric light if saying one thing does in so many cases leave behind it a need to improve and revise stirring besides regrets pleasures vanities and desiresif its all the facts i mean and the hats the fur boas the gentlemens swallowtail coats and pearl tiepins that come to the surfacewhat chance is there,1
of what it becomes every minute more difficult to say why in spite of everything i sit here believing i cant now say what or even remember the last time it happened,1
on the contrary it seems to me pretty sure that she whoever she may be is damned since its all a matter of flats and hats and sea gulls or so it seems to be for a hundred people sitting here well dressed walled in furred replete not that i can boast since i too sit passive on a gilt chair only turning the earth above a buried memory as we all do for there are signs if im not mistaken that were all recalling something furtively seeking something why fidget why so anxious about the sit of cloaks and gloveswhether to button or unbutton then watch that elderly face against the dark canvas a moment ago urbane and flushed now taciturn and sad as if in shadow was it the sound of the second violin tuning in the anteroom here they come four black figures carrying instruments and seat themselves facing the white squares under the downpour of light rest the tips of their bows on the music stand with a simultaneous movement lift them lightly poise them and looking across at the player opposite the first violin counts one two three,1
flourish spring burgeon burst the pear tree on the top of the mountain fountains jet drops descend but the waters of the rhone flow swift and deep race under the arches and sweep the trailing water leaves washing shadows over the silver fish the spotted fish rushed down by the swift waters now swept into an eddy whereits difficult thisconglomeration of fish all in a pool leaping splashing scraping sharp fins and such a boil of current that the yellow pebbles are churned round and round round and roundfree now rushing downwards or even somehow ascending in exquisite spirals into the air curled like thin shavings from under a plane up and up how lovely goodness is in those who stepping lightly go smiling through the world also in jolly old fishwives squatted under arches obscene old women how deeply they laugh and shake and rollick when they walk from side to side hum hah,1
but the tune like all his tunes makes one despairi mean hope what do i mean thats the worst of music i want to dance laugh eat pink cakes yellow cakes drink thin sharp wine or an indecent story nowi could relish that the older one grows the more one likes indecency hah hah im laughing what at you said nothing nor did the old gentleman opposite but supposesupposehush,1
the melancholy river bears us on when the moon comes through the trailing willow boughs i see your face i hear your voice and the bird singing as we pass the osier bed what are you whispering sorrow sorrow joy joy woven together like reeds in moonlight woven together inextricably commingled bound in pain and strewn in sorrowcrash,1
the boat sinks rising the figures ascend but now leaf thin tapering to a dusky wraith which fiery tipped draws its twofold passion from my heart for me it sings unseals my sorrow thaws compassion floods with love the sunless world nor ceasing abates its tenderness but deftly subtly weaves in and out until in this pattern this consummation the cleft ones unify soar sob sink to rest sorrow and joy,1
why then grieve ask what remain unsatisfied i say alls been settled yes laid to rest under a coverlet of rose leaves falling falling ah but they cease one rose leaf falling from an enormous height like a little parachute dropped from an invisible balloon turns flutters waveringly it wont reach us,1
no no i noticed nothing thats the worst of musicthese silly dreams the second violin was late you say,1
theres old mrs munro feeling her way outblinder each year poor womanon this slippery floor,1
eyeless old age greyheaded sphinx there she stands on the pavement beckoning so sternly the red omnibus,1
the tongue is but a clapper simplicity itself the feathers in the hat next me are bright and pleasing as a childs rattle the leaf on the planetree flashes green through the chink in the curtain very strange very exciting,1
sir i would trust you with my heart moreover we have left our bodies in the banqueting hall those on the turf are the shadows of our souls,1
then these are the embraces of our souls the lemons nod assent the swan pushes from the bank and floats dreaming into mid stream,1
but to return he followed me down the corridor and as we turned the corner trod on the lace of my petticoat what could i do but cry ah and stop to finger it at which he drew his sword made passes as if he were stabbing something to death and cried mad mad mad whereupon i screamed and the prince who was writing in the large vellum book in the oriel window came out in his velvet skullcap and furred slippers snatched a rapier from the wallthe king of spains gift you knowon which i escaped flinging on this cloak to hide the ravages to my skirtto hide but listen the horns,1
the gentleman replies so fast to the lady and she runs up the scale with such witty exchange of compliment now culminating in a sob of passion that the words are indistinguishable though the meaning is plain enoughlove laughter flight pursuit celestial blissall floated out on the gayest ripple of tender endearmentuntil the sound of the silver horns at first far distant gradually sounds more and more distinctly as if seneschals were saluting the dawn or proclaiming ominously the escape of the lovers the green garden moonlit pool lemons lovers and fish are all dissolved in the opal sky across which as the horns are joined by trumpets and supported by clarions there rise white arches firmly planted on marble pillars tramp and trumpeting clang and clangour firm establishment fast foundations march of myriads confusion and chaos trod to earth but this city to which we travel has neither stone nor marble hangs enduring stands unshakable nor does a face nor does a flag greet or welcome leave then to perish your hope droop in the desert my joy naked advance bare are the pillars auspicious to none casting no shade resplendent severe back then i fall eager no more desiring only to go find the street mark the buildings greet the applewoman say to the maid who opens the door a starry night,1
the pointed fingers of glass hang downwards the light slides down the glass and drops a pool of green all day long the ten fingers of the lustre drop green upon the marble the feathers of parakeetstheir harsh criessharp blades of palm treesgreen too green needles glittering in the sun but the hard glass drips on to the marble the pools hover above the dessert sand the camels lurch through them the pools settle on the marble rushes edge them weeds clog them here and there a white blossom the frog flops over at night the stars are set there unbroken evening comes and the shadow sweeps the green over the mantelpiece the ruffled surface of ocean no ships come the aimless waves sway beneath the empty sky its night the needles drip blots of blue the greens out,1
the snubnosed monster rises to the surface and spouts through his blunt nostrils two columns of water which fierywhite in the centre spray off into a fringe of blue beads strokes of blue line the black tarpaulin of his hide slushing the water through mouth and nostrils he sings heavy with water and the blue closes over him dowsing the polished pebbles of his eyes thrown upon the beach he lies blunt obtuse shedding dry blue scales their metallic blue stains the rusty iron on the beach blue are the ribs of the wrecked rowing boat a wave rolls beneath the blue bells but the cathedrals different cold incense laden faint blue with the veils of madonnas,1
from the ovalshaped flowerbed there rose perhaps a hundred stalks spreading into heartshaped or tongueshaped leaves half way up and unfurling at the tip red or blue or yellow petals marked with spots of colour raised upon the surface and from the red blue or yellow gloom of the throat emerged a straight bar rough with gold dust and slightly clubbed at the end the petals were voluminous enough to be stirred by the summer breeze and when they moved the red blue and yellow lights passed one over the other staining an inch of the brown earth beneath with a spot of the most intricate colour the light fell either upon the smooth grey back of a pebble or the shell of a snail with its brown circular veins or falling into a raindrop it expanded with such intensity of red blue and yellow the thin walls of water that one expected them to burst and disappear instead the drop was left in a second silver grey once more and the light now settled upon the flesh of a leaf revealing the branching thread of fibre beneath the surface and again it moved on and spread its illumination in the vast green spaces beneath the dome of the heartshaped and tongueshaped leaves then the breeze stirred rather more briskly overhead and the colour was flashed into the air above into the eyes of the men and women who walk in kew gardens in july,1
the figures of these men and women straggled past the flowerbed with a curiously irregular movement not unlike that of the white and blue butterflies who crossed the turf in zigzag flights from bed to bed the man was about six inches in front of the woman strolling carelessly while she bore on with greater purpose only turning her head now and then to see that the children were not too far behind the man kept this distance in front of the woman purposely though perhaps unconsciously for he wished to go on with his thoughts,1
fifteen years ago i came here with lily he thought we sat somewhere over there by a lake and i begged her to marry me all through the hot afternoon how the dragonfly kept circling round us how clearly i see the dragonfly and her shoe with the square silver buckle at the toe all the time i spoke i saw her shoe and when it moved impatiently i knew without looking up what she was going to say the whole of her seemed to be in her shoe and my love my desire were in the dragonfly for some reason i thought that if it settled there on that leaf the broad one with the red flower in the middle of it if the dragonfly settled on the leaf she would say yes at once but the dragonfly went round and round it never settled anywhereof course not happily not or i shouldnt be walking here with eleanor and the childrentell me eleanor dyou ever think of the past,1
because ive been thinking of the past ive been thinking of lily the woman i might have married well why are you silent do you mind my thinking of the past,1
why should i mind simon doesnt one always think of the past in a garden with men and women lying under the trees arent they ones past all that remains of it those men and women those ghosts lying under the trees ones happiness ones reality,1
for me a square silver shoe buckle and a dragonfly,1
for me a kiss imagine six little girls sitting before their easels twenty years ago down by the side of a lake painting the waterlilies the first red waterlilies id ever seen and suddenly a kiss there on the back of my neck and my hand shook all the afternoon so that i couldnt paint i took out my watch and marked the hour when i would allow myself to think of the kiss for five minutes onlyit was so preciousthe kiss of an old greyhaired woman with a wart on her nose the mother of all my kisses all my life come caroline come hubert,1
they walked on past the flowerbed now walking four abreast and soon diminished in size among the trees and looked half transparent as the sunlight and shade swam over their backs in large trembling irregular patches,1
in the oval flower bed the snail whose shell had been stained red blue and yellow for the space of two minutes or so now appeared to be moving very slightly in its shell and next began to labour over the crumbs of loose earth which broke away and rolled down as it passed over them it appeared to have a definite goal in front of it differing in this respect from the singular high stepping angular green insect who attempted to cross in front of it and waited for a second with its antenn trembling as if in deliberation and then stepped off as rapidly and strangely in the opposite direction brown cliffs with deep green lakes in the hollows flat bladelike trees that waved from root to tip round boulders of grey stone vast crumpled surfaces of a thin crackling textureall these objects lay across the snails progress between one stalk and another to his goal before he had decided whether to circumvent the arched tent of a dead leaf or to breast it there came past the bed the feet of other human beings,1
this time they were both men the younger of the two wore an expression of perhaps unnatural calm he raised his eyes and fixed them very steadily in front of him while his companion spoke and directly his companion had done speaking he looked on the ground again and sometimes opened his lips only after a long pause and sometimes did not open them at all the elder man had a curiously uneven and shaky method of walking jerking his hand forward and throwing up his head abruptly rather in the manner of an impatient carriage horse tired of waiting outside a house but in the man these gestures were irresolute and pointless he talked almost incessantly he smiled to himself and again began to talk as if the smile had been an answer he was talking about spiritsthe spirits of the dead who according to him were even now telling him all sorts of odd things about their experiences in heaven,1
heaven was known to the ancients as thessaly william and now with this war the spirit matter is rolling between the hills like thunder he paused seemed to listen smiled jerked his head and continued,1
you have a small electric battery and a piece of rubber to insulate the wireisolateinsulatewell well skip the details no good going into details that wouldnt be understoodand in short the little machine stands in any convenient position by the head of the bed we will say on a neat mahogany stand all arrangements being properly fixed by workmen under my direction the widow applies her ear and summons the spirit by sign as agreed women widows women in black,1
here he seemed to have caught sight of a womans dress in the distance which in the shade looked a purple black he took off his hat placed his hand upon his heart and hurried towards her muttering and gesticulating feverishly but william caught him by the sleeve and touched a flower with the tip of his walkingstick in order to divert the old mans attention after looking at it for a moment in some confusion the old man bent his ear to it and seemed to answer a voice speaking from it for he began talking about the forests of uruguay which he had visited hundreds of years ago in company with the most beautiful young woman in europe he could be heard murmuring about forests of uruguay blanketed with the wax petals of tropical roses nightingales sea beaches mermaids and women drowned at sea as he suffered himself to be moved on by william upon whose face the look of stoical patience grew slowly deeper and deeper,1
following his steps so closely as to be slightly puzzled by his gestures came two elderly women of the lower middle class one stout and ponderous the other rosy cheeked and nimble like most people of their station they were frankly fascinated by any signs of eccentricity betokening a disordered brain especially in the welltodo but they were too far off to be certain whether the gestures were merely eccentric or genuinely mad after they had scrutinised the old mans back in silence for a moment and given each other a queer sly look they went on energetically piecing together their very complicated dialogue,1
nell bert lot cess phil pa he says i says she says i says i says i says,1
the ponderous woman looked through the pattern of falling words at the flowers standing cool firm and upright in the earth with a curious expression she saw them as a sleeper waking from a heavy sleep sees a brass candlestick reflecting the light in an unfamiliar way and closes his eyes and opens them and seeing the brass candlestick again finally starts broad awake and stares at the candlestick with all his powers so the heavy woman came to a standstill opposite the ovalshaped flower bed and ceased even to pretend to listen to what the other woman was saying she stood there letting the words fall over her swaying the top part of her body slowly backwards and forwards looking at the flowers then she suggested that they should find a seat and have their tea,1
the snail had now considered every possible method of reaching his goal without going round the dead leaf or climbing over it let alone the effort needed for climbing a leaf he was doubtful whether the thin texture which vibrated with such an alarming crackle when touched even by the tip of his horns would bear his weight and this determined him finally to creep beneath it for there was a point where the leaf curved high enough from the ground to admit him he had just inserted his head in the opening and was taking stock of the high brown roof and was getting used to the cool brown light when two other people came past outside on the turf this time they were both young a young man and a young woman they were both in the prime of youth or even in that season which precedes the prime of youth the season before the smooth pink folds of the flower have burst their gummy case when the wings of the butterfly though fully grown are motionless in the sun,1
long pauses came between each of these remarks they were uttered in toneless and monotonous voices the couple stood still on the edge of the flower bed and together pressed the end of her parasol deep down into the soft earth the action and the fact that his hand rested on the top of hers expressed their feelings in a strange way as these short insignificant words also expressed something words with short wings for their heavy body of meaning inadequate to carry them far and thus alighting awkwardly upon the very common objects that surrounded them and were to their inexperienced touch so massive but who knows so they thought as they pressed the parasol into the earth what precipices arent concealed in them or what slopes of ice dont shine in the sun on the other side who knows who has ever seen this before even when she wondered what sort of tea they gave you at kew he felt that something loomed up behind her words and stood vast and solid behind them and the mist very slowly rose and uncoveredo heavens what were those shapeslittle white tables and waitresses who looked first at her and then at him and there was a bill that he would pay with a real two shilling piece and it was real all real he assured himself fingering the coin in his pocket real to everyone except to him and to her even to him it began to seem real and thenbut it was too exciting to stand and think any longer and he pulled the parasol out of the earth with a jerk and was impatient to find the place where one had tea with other people like other people,1
wherever does one have ones tea she asked with the oddest thrill of excitement in her voice looking vaguely round and letting herself be drawn on down the grass path trailing her parasol turning her head this way and that way forgetting her tea wishing to go down there and then down there remembering orchids and cranes among wild flowers a chinese pagoda and a crimson crested bird but he bore her on,1
thus one couple after another with much the same irregular and aimless movement passed the flowerbed and were enveloped in layer after layer of green blue vapour in which at first their bodies had substance and a dash of colour but later both substance and colour dissolved in the greenblue atmosphere how hot it was so hot that even the thrush chose to hop like a mechanical bird in the shadow of the flowers with long pauses between one movement and the next instead of rambling vaguely the white butterflies danced one above another making with their white shifting flakes the outline of a shattered marble column above the tallest flowers the glass roofs of the palm house shone as if a whole market full of shiny green umbrellas had opened in the sun and in the drone of the aeroplane the voice of the summer sky murmured its fierce soul yellow and black pink and snow white shapes of all these colours men women and children were spotted for a second upon the horizon and then seeing the breadth of yellow that lay upon the grass they wavered and sought shade beneath the trees dissolving like drops of water in the yellow and green atmosphere staining it faintly with red and blue it seemed as if all gross and heavy bodies had sunk down in the heat motionless and lay huddled upon the ground but their voices went wavering from them as if they were flames lolling from the thick waxen bodies of candles voices yes voices wordless voices breaking the silence suddenly with such depth of contentment such passion of desire or in the voices of children such freshness of surprise breaking the silence but there was no silence all the time the motor omnibuses were turning their wheels and changing their gear like a vast nest of chinese boxes all of wrought steel turning ceaselessly one within another the city murmured on the top of which the voices cried aloud and the petals of myriads of flowers flashed their colours into the air,1
perhaps it was the middle of january in the present year that i first looked up and saw the mark on the wall in order to fix a date it is necessary to remember what one saw so now i think of the fire the steady film of yellow light upon the page of my book the three chrysanthemums in the round glass bowl on the mantelpiece yes it must have been the winter time and we had just finished our tea for i remember that i was smoking a cigarette when i looked up and saw the mark on the wall for the first time i looked up through the smoke of my cigarette and my eye lodged for a moment upon the burning coals and that old fancy of the crimson flag flapping from the castle tower came into my mind and i thought of the cavalcade of red knights riding up the side of the black rock rather to my relief the sight of the mark interrupted the fancy for it is an old fancy an automatic fancy made as a child perhaps the mark was a small round mark black upon the white wall about six or seven inches above the mantelpiece,1
how readily our thoughts swarm upon a new object lifting it a little way as ants carry a blade of straw so feverishly and then leave it if that mark was made by a nail it cant have been for a picture it must have been for a miniaturethe miniature of a lady with white powdered curls powderdusted cheeks and lips like red carnations a fraud of course for the people who had this house before us would have chosen pictures in that wayan old picture for an old room that is the sort of people they werevery interesting people and i think of them so often in such queer places because one will never see them again never know what happened next they wanted to leave this house because they wanted to change their style of furniture so he said and he was in process of saying that in his opinion art should have ideas behind it when we were torn asunder as one is torn from the old lady about to pour out tea and the young man about to hit the tennis ball in the back garden of the suburban villa as one rushes past in the train,1
but as for that mark im not sure about it i dont believe it was made by a nail after all its too big too round for that i might get up but if i got up and looked at it ten to one i shouldnt be able to say for certain because once a things done no one ever knows how it happened oh dear me the mystery of life the inaccuracy of thought the ignorance of humanity to show how very little control of our possessions we havewhat an accidental affair this living is after all our civilizationlet me just count over a few of the things lost in one lifetime beginning for that seems always the most mysterious of losseswhat cat would gnaw what rat would nibblethree pale blue canisters of bookbinding tools then there were the bird cages the iron hoops the steel skates the queen anne coalscuttle the bagatelle board the hand organall gone and jewels too opals and emeralds they lie about the roots of turnips what a scraping paring affair it is to be sure the wonder is that ive any clothes on my back that i sit surrounded by solid furniture at this moment why if one wants to compare life to anything one must liken it to being blown through the tube at fifty miles an hourlanding at the other end without a single hairpin in ones hair shot out at the feet of god entirely naked tumbling head over heels in the asphodel meadows like brown paper parcels pitched down a shoot in the post office with ones hair flying back like the tail of a racehorse yes that seems to express the rapidity of life the perpetual waste and repair all so casual all so haphazard,1
but after life the slow pulling down of thick green stalks so that the cup of the flower as it turns over deluges one with purple and red light why after all should one not be born there as one is born here helpless speechless unable to focus ones eyesight groping at the roots of the grass at the toes of the giants as for saying which are trees and which are men and women or whether there are such things that one wont be in a condition to do for fifty years or so there will be nothing but spaces of light and dark intersected by thick stalks and rather higher up perhaps roseshaped blots of an indistinct colourdim pinks and blueswhich will as time goes on become more definite becomei dont know what,1
and yet that mark on the wall is not a hole at all it may even be caused by some round black substance such as a small rose leaf left over from the summer and i not being a very vigilant housekeeperlook at the dust on the mantelpiece for example the dust which so they say buried troy three times over only fragments of pots utterly refusing annihilation as one can believe,1
the tree outside the window taps very gently on the pane i want to think quietly calmly spaciously never to be interrupted never to have to rise from my chair to slip easily from one thing to another without any sense of hostility or obstacle i want to sink deeper and deeper away from the surface with its hard separate facts to steady myself let me catch hold of the first idea that passes shakespeare well he will do as well as another a man who sat himself solidly in an armchair and looked into the fire soa shower of ideas fell perpetually from some very high heaven down through his mind he leant his forehead on his hand and people looking in through the open doorfor this scene is supposed to take place on a summers eveningbut how dull this is this historical fiction it doesnt interest me at all i wish i could hit upon a pleasant track of thought a track indirectly reflecting credit upon myself for those are the pleasantest thoughts and very frequent even in the minds of modest mousecoloured people who believe genuinely that they dislike to hear their own praises they are not thoughts directly praising oneself that is the beauty of them they are thoughts like this,1
and then i came into the room they were discussing botany i said how id seen a flower growing on a dust heap on the site of an old house in kingsway the seed i said must have been sown in the reign of charles the first what flowers grew in the reign of charles the first i askedbut i dont remember the answer tall flowers with purple tassels to them perhaps and so it goes on all the time im dressing up the figure of myself in my own mind lovingly stealthily not openly adoring it for if i did that i should catch myself out and stretch my hand at once for a book in selfprotection indeed it is curious how instinctively one protects the image of oneself from idolatry or any other handling that could make it ridiculous or too unlike the original to be believed in any longer or is it not so very curious after all it is a matter of great importance suppose the looking glass smashes the image disappears and the romantic figure with the green of forest depths all about it is there no longer but only that shell of a person which is seen by other peoplewhat an airless shallow bald prominent world it becomes a world not to be lived in as we face each other in omnibuses and underground railways we are looking into the mirror that accounts for the vagueness the gleam of glassiness in our eyes and the novelists in future will realize more and more the importance of these reflections for of course there is not one reflection but an almost infinite number those are the depths they will explore those the phantoms they will pursue leaving the description of reality more and more out of their stories taking a knowledge of it for granted as the greeks did and shakespeare perhapsbut these generalizations are very worthless the military sound of the word is enough it recalls leading articles cabinet ministersa whole class of things indeed which as a child one thought the thing itself the standard thing the real thing from which one could not depart save at the risk of nameless damnation generalizations bring back somehow sunday in london sunday afternoon walks sunday luncheons and also ways of speaking of the dead clothes and habitslike the habit of sitting all together in one room until a certain hour although nobody liked it there was a rule for everything the rule for tablecloths at that particular period was that they should be made of tapestry with little yellow compartments marked upon them such as you may see in photographs of the carpets in the corridors of the royal palaces tablecloths of a different kind were not real tablecloths how shocking and yet how wonderful it was to discover that these real things sunday luncheons sunday walks country houses and tablecloths were not entirely real were indeed half phantoms and the damnation which visited the disbeliever in them was only a sense of illegitimate freedom what now takes the place of those things i wonder those real standard things men perhaps should you be a woman the masculine point of view which governs our lives which sets the standard which establishes whitakers table of precedency which has become i suppose since the war half a phantom to many men and women which soon one may hope will be laughed into the dustbin where the phantoms go the mahogany sideboards and the landseer prints gods and devils hell and so forth leaving us all with an intoxicating sense of illegitimate freedomif freedom exists,1
in certain lights that mark on the wall seems actually to project from the wall nor is it entirely circular i cannot be sure but it seems to cast a perceptible shadow suggesting that if i ran my finger down that strip of the wall it would at a certain point mount and descend a small tumulus a smooth tumulus like those barrows on the south downs which are they say either tombs or camps of the two i should prefer them to be tombs desiring melancholy like most english people and finding it natural at the end of a walk to think of the bones stretched beneath the turf there must be some book about it some antiquary must have dug up those bones and given them a name what sort of a man is an antiquary i wonder retired colonels for the most part i daresay leading parties of aged labourers to the top here examining clods of earth and stone and getting into correspondence with the neighbouring clergy which being opened at breakfast time gives them a feeling of importance and the comparison of arrowheads necessitates crosscountry journeys to the county towns an agreeable necessity both to them and to their elderly wives who wish to make plum jam or to clean out the study and have every reason for keeping that great question of the camp or the tomb in perpetual suspension while the colonel himself feels agreeably philosophic in accumulating evidence on both sides of the question it is true that he does finally incline to believe in the camp and being opposed indites a pamphlet which he is about to read at the quarterly meeting of the local society when a stroke lays him low and his last conscious thoughts are not of wife or child but of the camp and that arrowhead there which is now in the case at the local museum together with the foot of a chinese murderess a handful of elizabethan nails a great many tudor clay pipes a piece of roman pottery and the wineglass that nelson drank out ofproving i really dont know what,1
no no nothing is proved nothing is known and if i were to get up at this very moment and ascertain that the mark on the wall is reallywhat shall we saythe head of a gigantic old nail driven in two hundred years ago which has now owing to the patient attrition of many generations of housemaids revealed its head above the coat of paint and is taking its first view of modern life in the sight of a whitewalled firelit room what should i gainknowledge matter for further speculation i can think sitting still as well as standing up and what is knowledge what are our learned men save the descendants of witches and hermits who crouched in caves and in woods brewing herbs interrogating shrewmice and writing down the language of the stars and the less we honour them as our superstitions dwindle and our respect for beauty and health of mind increases yes one could imagine a very pleasant world a quiet spacious world with the flowers so red and blue in the open fields a world without professors or specialists or housekeepers with the profiles of policemen a world which one could slice with ones thought as a fish slices the water with his fin grazing the stems of the waterlilies hanging suspended over nests of white sea eggs how peaceful it is down here rooted in the centre of the world and gazing up through the grey waters with their sudden gleams of light and their reflectionsif it were not for whitakers almanackif it were not for the table of precedency,1
i must jump up and see for myself what that mark on the wall really isa nail a roseleaf a crack in the wood,1
here is nature once more at her old game of selfpreservation this train of thought she perceives is threatening mere waste of energy even some collision with reality for who will ever be able to lift a finger against whitakers table of precedency the archbishop of canterbury is followed by the lord high chancellor the lord high chancellor is followed by the archbishop of york everybody follows somebody such is the philosophy of whitaker and the great thing is to know who follows whom whitaker knows and let that so nature counsels comfort you instead of enraging you and if you cant be comforted if you must shatter this hour of peace think of the mark on the wall,1
i understand natures gameher prompting to take action as a way of ending any thought that threatens to excite or to pain hence i suppose comes our slight contempt for men of actionmen we assume who dont think still theres no harm in putting a full stop to ones disagreeable thoughts by looking at a mark on the wall,1
indeed now that i have fixed my eyes upon it i feel that i have grasped a plank in the sea i feel a satisfying sense of reality which at once turns the two archbishops and the lord high chancellor to the shadows of shades here is something definite something real thus waking from a midnight dream of horror one hastily turns on the light and lies quiescent worshipping the chest of drawers worshipping solidity worshipping reality worshipping the impersonal world which is a proof of some existence other than ours that is what one wants to be sure of wood is a pleasant thing to think about it comes from a tree and trees grow and we dont know how they grow for years and years they grow without paying any attention to us in meadows in forests and by the side of riversall things one likes to think about the cows swish their tails beneath them on hot afternoons they paint rivers so green that when a moorhen dives one expects to see its feathers all green when it comes up again i like to think of the fish balanced against the stream like flags blown out and of waterbeetles slowly raising domes of mud upon the bed of the river i like to think of the tree itself first the close dry sensation of being wood then the grinding of the storm then the slow delicious ooze of sap i like to think of it too on winters nights standing in the empty field with all leaves closefurled nothing tender exposed to the iron bullets of the moon a naked mast upon an earth that goes tumbling tumbling all night long the song of birds must sound very loud and strange in june and how cold the feet of insects must feel upon it as they make laborious progresses up the creases of the bark or sun themselves upon the thin green awning of the leaves and look straight in front of them with diamondcut red eyes one by one the fibres snap beneath the immense cold pressure of the earth then the last storm comes and falling the highest branches drive deep into the ground again even so life isnt done with there are a million patient watchful lives still for a tree all over the world in bedrooms in ships on the pavement lining rooms where men and women sit after tea smoking cigarettes it is full of peaceful thoughts happy thoughts this tree i should like to take each one separatelybut something is getting in the way where was i what has it all been about a tree a river the downs whitakers almanack the fields of asphodel i cant remember a thing everythings moving falling slipping vanishing there is a vast upheaval of matter someone is standing over me and saying,1
though its no good buying newspapers nothing ever happens curse this war god damn this war all the same i dont see why we should have a snail on our wall,1
ah the mark on the wall it was a snail,1

horace walpole was the youngest son of sir robert walpole the great statesman who died earl of orford he was born in the year in which his father resigned office remaining in opposition for almost three years before his return to a long tenure of power horace walpole was educated at eton where he formed a school friendship with thomas gray who was but a few months older in gray was travellingcompanion with walpole in france and italy until they differed and parted but the friendship was afterwards renewed and remained firm to the end horace walpole went from eton to kings college cambridge and entered parliament in the year before his fathers final resignation and acceptance of an earldom his way of life was made easy to him as usher of the exchequer comptroller of the pipe and clerk of the estreats in the exchequer he received nearly two thousand a year for doing nothing lived with his father and amused himself,2
horace walpole idled and amused himself with the small life of the fashionable world to which he was proud of belonging though he had a quick eye for its vanities he had social wit and liked to put it to small uses but he was not an empty idler and there were seasons when he could become a sharp judge of himself i am sensible he wrote to his most intimate friend i am sensible of having more follies and weaknesses and fewer real good qualities than most men i sometimes reflect on this though i own too seldom i always want to begin acting like a man and a sensible one which i think i might be if i would he had deep home affections and under many polite affectations plenty of good sense,2
horace walpoles father died in the eldest son who succeeded to the earldom died in and left a son george who was for a time insane and lived until as george left no child the title and estates passed to horace walpole then seventyfour years old and the only uncle who survived horace walpole thus became earl of orford during the last six years of his life as to the title he said that he felt himself being called names in his old age he died unmarried in the year at the age of eighty,2
he had turned his house at strawberry hill by the thames near twickenham into a gothic villaeighteenthcentury gothicand amused himself by spending freely upon its adornment with such things as were then fashionable as objects of taste but he delighted also in his flowers and his trellises of roses and the quiet thames when confined by gout to his london house in arlington street flowers from strawberry hill and a bird were necessary consolations he set up also at strawberry hill a private printing press at which he printed his friend grays poems also in his own catalogue of the royal and noble authors of england and five volumes of anecdotes of painting in england between and,2
horace walpole produced the castle of otranto in at the mature age of fortyeight it was suggested by a dream from which he said he waked one morning and of which all i could recover was that i had thought myself in an ancient castle a very natural dream for a head like mine filled with gothic story and that on the uppermost banister of a great staircase i saw a gigantic hand in armour in the evening i sat down and began to write without knowing in the least what i intended to say or relate so began the tale which professed to be translated by william marshal gentleman from the italian of onuphro muralto canon of the church of st nicholas at otranto it was written in two months walpoles friend gray reported to him that at cambridge the book made some of them cry a little and all in general afraid to go to bed o nights the castle of otranto was in its own way an early sign of the reaction towards romance in the latter part of the last century this gives it interest but it has had many followers and the hardy modern reader when he reads grays note from cambridge needs to be reminded of its date,2
the following work was found in the library of an ancient catholic family in the north of england it was printed at naples in the black letter in the year how much sooner it was written does not appear the principal incidents are such as were believed in the darkest ages of christianity but the language and conduct have nothing that savours of barbarism the style is the purest italian,2
if the story was written near the time when it is supposed to have happened it must have been between the era of the first crusade and the date of the last or not long afterwards there is no other circumstance in the work that can lead us to guess at the period in which the scene is laid the names of the actors are evidently fictitious and probably disguised on purpose yet the spanish names of the domestics seem to indicate that this work was not composed until the establishment of the arragonian kings in naples had made spanish appellations familiar in that country the beauty of the diction and the zeal of the author moderated however by singular judgment concur to make me think that the date of the composition was little antecedent to that of the impression letters were then in their most flourishing state in italy and contributed to dispel the empire of superstition at that time so forcibly attacked by the reformers it is not unlikely that an artful priest might endeavour to turn their own arms on the innovators and might avail himself of his abilities as an author to confirm the populace in their ancient errors and superstitions if this was his view he has certainly acted with signal address such a work as the following would enslave a hundred vulgar minds beyond half the books of controversy that have been written from the days of luther to the present hour,2
this solution of the authors motives is however offered as a mere conjecture whatever his views were or whatever effects the execution of them might have his work can only be laid before the public at present as a matter of entertainment even as such some apology for it is necessary miracles visions necromancy dreams and other preternatural events are exploded now even from romances that was not the case when our author wrote much less when the story itself is supposed to have happened belief in every kind of prodigy was so established in those dark ages that an author would not be faithful to the manners of the times who should omit all mention of them he is not bound to believe them himself but he must represent his actors as believing them,2
if this air of the miraculous is excused the reader will find nothing else unworthy of his perusal allow the possibility of the facts and all the actors comport themselves as persons would do in their situation there is no bombast no similes flowers digressions or unnecessary descriptions everything tends directly to the catastrophe never is the readers attention relaxed the rules of the drama are almost observed throughout the conduct of the piece the characters are well drawn and still better maintained terror the authors principal engine prevents the story from ever languishing and it is so often contrasted by pity that the mind is kept up in a constant vicissitude of interesting passions,2
some persons may perhaps think the characters of the domestics too little serious for the general cast of the story but besides their opposition to the principal personages the art of the author is very observable in his conduct of the subalterns they discover many passages essential to the story which could not be well brought to light but by their navet and simplicity in particular the womanish terror and foibles of bianca in the last chapter conduce essentially towards advancing the catastrophe,2
it is natural for a translator to be prejudiced in favour of his adopted work more impartial readers may not be so much struck with the beauties of this piece as i was yet i am not blind to my authors defects i could wish he had grounded his plan on a more useful moral than this that the sins of fathers are visited on their children to the third and fourth generation i doubt whether in his time any more than at present ambition curbed its appetite of dominion from the dread of so remote a punishment and yet this moral is weakened by that less direct insinuation that even such anathema may be diverted by devotion to st nicholas here the interest of the monk plainly gets the better of the judgment of the author however with all its faults i have no doubt but the english reader will be pleased with a sight of this performance the piety that reigns throughout the lessons of virtue that are inculcated and the rigid purity of the sentiments exempt this work from the censure to which romances are but too liable should it meet with the success i hope for i may be encouraged to reprint the original italian though it will tend to depreciate my own labour our language falls far short of the charms of the italian both for variety and harmony the latter is peculiarly excellent for simple narrative it is difficult in english to relate without falling too low or rising too high a fault obviously occasioned by the little care taken to speak pure language in common conversation every italian or frenchman of any rank piques himself on speaking his own tongue correctly and with choice i cannot flatter myself with having done justice to my author in this respect his style is as elegant as his conduct of the passions is masterly it is a pity that he did not apply his talents to what they were evidently proper forthe theatre,2
i will detain the reader no longer but to make one short remark though the machinery is invention and the names of the actors imaginary i cannot but believe that the groundwork of the story is founded on truth the scene is undoubtedly laid in some real castle the author seems frequently without design to describe particular parts the chamber says he on the right hand the door on the left hand the distance from the chapel to conrads apartment these and other passages are strong presumptions that the author had some certain building in his eye curious persons who have leisure to employ in such researches may possibly discover in the italian writers the foundation on which our author has built if a catastrophe at all resembling that which he describes is believed to have given rise to this work it will contribute to interest the reader and will make the castle of otranto a still more moving story,2
the gentle maid whose hapless tale these melancholy pages speak say gracious lady shall she fail to draw the tear adown thy cheek,2
no never was thy pitying breast insensible to human woes tender tho firm it melts distrest for weaknesses it never knows,2
oh guard the marvels i relate of fell ambition scourgd by fate from reasons peevish blame blest with thy smile my dauntless sail i dare expand to fancys gale for sure thy smiles are fame,2
manfred prince of otranto had one son and one daughter the latter a most beautiful virgin aged eighteen was called matilda conrad the son was three years younger a homely youth sickly and of no promising disposition yet he was the darling of his father who never showed any symptoms of affection to matilda manfred had contracted a marriage for his son with the marquis of vicenzas daughter isabella and she had already been delivered by her guardians into the hands of manfred that he might celebrate the wedding as soon as conrads infirm state of health would permit,2
manfreds impatience for this ceremonial was remarked by his family and neighbours the former indeed apprehending the severity of their princes disposition did not dare to utter their surmises on this precipitation hippolita his wife an amiable lady did sometimes venture to represent the danger of marrying their only son so early considering his great youth and greater infirmities but she never received any other answer than reflections on her own sterility who had given him but one heir his tenants and subjects were less cautious in their discourses they attributed this hasty wedding to the princes dread of seeing accomplished an ancient prophecy which was said to have pronounced that the castle and lordship of otranto should pass from the present family whenever the real owner should be grown too large to inhabit it it was difficult to make any sense of this prophecy and still less easy to conceive what it had to do with the marriage in question yet these mysteries or contradictions did not make the populace adhere the less to their opinion,2
young conrads birthday was fixed for his espousals the company was assembled in the chapel of the castle and everything ready for beginning the divine office when conrad himself was missing manfred impatient of the least delay and who had not observed his son retire despatched one of his attendants to summon the young prince the servant who had not stayed long enough to have crossed the court to conrads apartment came running back breathless in a frantic manner his eyes staring and foaming at the mouth he said nothing but pointed to the court,2
the company were struck with terror and amazement the princess hippolita without knowing what was the matter but anxious for her son swooned away manfred less apprehensive than enraged at the procrastination of the nuptials and at the folly of his domestic asked imperiously what was the matter the fellow made no answer but continued pointing towards the courtyard and at last after repeated questions put to him cried out oh the helmet the helmet,2
in the meantime some of the company had run into the court from whence was heard a confused noise of shrieks horror and surprise manfred who began to be alarmed at not seeing his son went himself to get information of what occasioned this strange confusion matilda remained endeavouring to assist her mother and isabella stayed for the same purpose and to avoid showing any impatience for the bridegroom for whom in truth she had conceived little affection,2
the first thing that struck manfreds eyes was a group of his servants endeavouring to raise something that appeared to him a mountain of sable plumes he gazed without believing his sight,2
what are ye doing cried manfred wrathfully where is my son,2
a volley of voices replied oh my lord the prince the prince the helmet the helmet,2
shocked with these lamentable sounds and dreading he knew not what he advanced hastilybut what a sight for a fathers eyeshe beheld his child dashed to pieces and almost buried under an enormous helmet an hundred times more large than any casque ever made for human being and shaded with a proportionable quantity of black feathers,2
the horror of the spectacle the ignorance of all around how this misfortune had happened and above all the tremendous phenomenon before him took away the princes speech yet his silence lasted longer than even grief could occasion he fixed his eyes on what he wished in vain to believe a vision and seemed less attentive to his loss than buried in meditation on the stupendous object that had occasioned it he touched he examined the fatal casque nor could even the bleeding mangled remains of the young prince divert the eyes of manfred from the portent before him,2
all who had known his partial fondness for young conrad were as much surprised at their princes insensibility as thunderstruck themselves at the miracle of the helmet they conveyed the disfigured corpse into the hall without receiving the least direction from manfred as little was he attentive to the ladies who remained in the chapel on the contrary without mentioning the unhappy princesses his wife and daughter the first sounds that dropped from manfreds lips were take care of the lady isabella,2
the domestics without observing the singularity of this direction were guided by their affection to their mistress to consider it as peculiarly addressed to her situation and flew to her assistance they conveyed her to her chamber more dead than alive and indifferent to all the strange circumstances she heard except the death of her son,2
matilda who doted on her mother smothered her own grief and amazement and thought of nothing but assisting and comforting her afflicted parent isabella who had been treated by hippolita like a daughter and who returned that tenderness with equal duty and affection was scarce less assiduous about the princess at the same time endeavouring to partake and lessen the weight of sorrow which she saw matilda strove to suppress for whom she had conceived the warmest sympathy of friendship yet her own situation could not help finding its place in her thoughts she felt no concern for the death of young conrad except commiseration and she was not sorry to be delivered from a marriage which had promised her little felicity either from her destined bridegroom or from the severe temper of manfred who though he had distinguished her by great indulgence had imprinted her mind with terror from his causeless rigour to such amiable princesses as hippolita and matilda,2
while the ladies were conveying the wretched mother to her bed manfred remained in the court gazing on the ominous casque and regardless of the crowd which the strangeness of the event had now assembled around him the few words he articulated tended solely to inquiries whether any man knew from whence it could have come nobody could give him the least information however as it seemed to be the sole object of his curiosity it soon became so to the rest of the spectators whose conjectures were as absurd and improbable as the catastrophe itself was unprecedented in the midst of their senseless guesses a young peasant whom rumour had drawn thither from a neighbouring village observed that the miraculous helmet was exactly like that on the figure in black marble of alfonso the good one of their former princes in the church of st nicholas,2
villain what sayest thou cried manfred starting from his trance in a tempest of rage and seizing the young man by the collar how darest thou utter such treason thy life shall pay for it,2
the spectators who as little comprehended the cause of the princes fury as all the rest they had seen were at a loss to unravel this new circumstance the young peasant himself was still more astonished not conceiving how he had offended the prince yet recollecting himself with a mixture of grace and humility he disengaged himself from manfreds grip and then with an obeisance which discovered more jealousy of innocence than dismay he asked with respect of what he was guilty manfred more enraged at the vigour however decently exerted with which the young man had shaken off his hold than appeased by his submission ordered his attendants to seize him and if he had not been withheld by his friends whom he had invited to the nuptials would have poignarded the peasant in their arms,2
during this altercation some of the vulgar spectators had run to the great church which stood near the castle and came back openmouthed declaring that the helmet was missing from alfonsos statue manfred at this news grew perfectly frantic and as if he sought a subject on which to vent the tempest within him he rushed again on the young peasant crying,2
villain monster sorcerer tis thou hast done this tis thou hast slain my son,2
the mob who wanted some object within the scope of their capacities on whom they might discharge their bewildered reasoning caught the words from the mouth of their lord and reechoed,2
ay ay tis he tis he he has stolen the helmet from good alfonsos tomb and dashed out the brains of our young prince with it never reflecting how enormous the disproportion was between the marble helmet that had been in the church and that of steel before their eyes nor how impossible it was for a youth seemingly not twenty to wield a piece of armour of so prodigious a weight,2
the folly of these ejaculations brought manfred to himself yet whether provoked at the peasant having observed the resemblance between the two helmets and thereby led to the farther discovery of the absence of that in the church or wishing to bury any such rumour under so impertinent a supposition he gravely pronounced that the young man was certainly a necromancer and that till the church could take cognisance of the affair he would have the magician whom they had thus detected kept prisoner under the helmet itself which he ordered his attendants to raise and place the young man under it declaring he should be kept there without food with which his own infernal art might furnish him,2
it was in vain for the youth to represent against this preposterous sentence in vain did manfreds friends endeavour to divert him from this savage and illgrounded resolution the generality were charmed with their lords decision which to their apprehensions carried great appearance of justice as the magician was to be punished by the very instrument with which he had offended nor were they struck with the least compunction at the probability of the youth being starved for they firmly believed that by his diabolic skill he could easily supply himself with nutriment,2
manfred thus saw his commands even cheerfully obeyed and appointing a guard with strict orders to prevent any food being conveyed to the prisoner he dismissed his friends and attendants and retired to his own chamber after locking the gates of the castle in which he suffered none but his domestics to remain,2
in the meantime the care and zeal of the young ladies had brought the princess hippolita to herself who amidst the transports of her own sorrow frequently demanded news of her lord would have dismissed her attendants to watch over him and at last enjoined matilda to leave her and visit and comfort her father matilda who wanted no affectionate duty to manfred though she trembled at his austerity obeyed the orders of hippolita whom she tenderly recommended to isabella and inquiring of the domestics for her father was informed that he was retired to his chamber and had commanded that nobody should have admittance to him concluding that he was immersed in sorrow for the death of her brother and fearing to renew his tears by the sight of his sole remaining child she hesitated whether she should break in upon his affliction yet solicitude for him backed by the commands of her mother encouraged her to venture disobeying the orders he had given a fault she had never been guilty of before,2
the gentle timidity of her nature made her pause for some minutes at his door she heard him traverse his chamber backwards and forwards with disordered steps a mood which increased her apprehensions she was however just going to beg admittance when manfred suddenly opened the door and as it was now twilight concurring with the disorder of his mind he did not distinguish the person but asked angrily who it was matilda replied trembling,2
manfred stepping back hastily cried begone i do not want a daughter and flinging back abruptly clapped the door against the terrified matilda,2
she was too well acquainted with her fathers impetuosity to venture a second intrusion when she had a little recovered the shock of so bitter a reception she wiped away her tears to prevent the additional stab that the knowledge of it would give to hippolita who questioned her in the most anxious terms on the health of manfred and how he bore his loss matilda assured her he was well and supported his misfortune with manly fortitude,2
but will he not let me see him said hippolita mournfully will he not permit me to blend my tears with his and shed a mothers sorrows in the bosom of her lord or do you deceive me matilda i know how manfred doted on his son is not the stroke too heavy for him has he not sunk under it you do not answer mealas i dread the worstraise me my maidens i will i will see my lord bear me to him instantly he is dearer to me even than my children,2
matilda made signs to isabella to prevent hippolitas rising and both those lovely young women were using their gentle violence to stop and calm the princess when a servant on the part of manfred arrived and told isabella that his lord demanded to speak with her,2
go said hippolita relieved by a message from her lord manfred cannot support the sight of his own family he thinks you less disordered than we are and dreads the shock of my grief console him dear isabella and tell him i will smother my own anguish rather than add to his,2
as it was now evening the servant who conducted isabella bore a torch before her when they came to manfred who was walking impatiently about the gallery he started and said hastily,2
then shutting the door impetuously he flung himself upon a bench against the wall and bade isabella sit by him she obeyed trembling,2
i sent for you lady said heand then stopped under great appearance of confusion,2
yes i sent for you on a matter of great moment resumed he dry your tears young ladyyou have lost your bridegroom yes cruel fate and i have lost the hopes of my race but conrad was not worthy of your beauty,2
how my lord said isabella sure you do not suspect me of not feeling the concern i ought my duty and affection would have always,2
think no more of him interrupted manfred he was a sickly puny child and heaven has perhaps taken him away that i might not trust the honours of my house on so frail a foundation the line of manfred calls for numerous supports my foolish fondness for that boy blinded the eyes of my prudencebut it is better as it is i hope in a few years to have reason to rejoice at the death of conrad,2
words cannot paint the astonishment of isabella at first she apprehended that grief had disordered manfreds understanding her next thought suggested that this strange discourse was designed to ensnare her she feared that manfred had perceived her indifference for his son and in consequence of that idea she replied,2
good my lord do not doubt my tenderness my heart would have accompanied my hand conrad would have engrossed all my care and wherever fate shall dispose of me i shall always cherish his memory and regard your highness and the virtuous hippolita as my parents,2
curse on hippolita cried manfred forget her from this moment as i do in short lady you have missed a husband undeserving of your charms they shall now be better disposed of instead of a sickly boy you shall have a husband in the prime of his age who will know how to value your beauties and who may expect a numerous offspring,2
alas my lord said isabella my mind is too sadly engrossed by the recent catastrophe in your family to think of another marriage if ever my father returns and it shall be his pleasure i shall obey as i did when i consented to give my hand to your son but until his return permit me to remain under your hospitable roof and employ the melancholy hours in assuaging yours hippolitas and the fair matildas affliction,2
i desired you once before said manfred angrily not to name that woman from this hour she must be a stranger to you as she must be to me in short isabella since i cannot give you my son i offer you myself,2
heavens cried isabella waking from her delusion what do i hear you my lord you my fatherinlaw the father of conrad the husband of the virtuous and tender hippolita,2
i tell you said manfred imperiously hippolita is no longer my wife i divorce her from this hour too long has she cursed me by her unfruitfulness my fate depends on having sons and this night i trust will give a new date to my hopes,2
at those words he seized the cold hand of isabella who was half dead with fright and horror she shrieked and started from him manfred rose to pursue her when the moon which was now up and gleamed in at the opposite casement presented to his sight the plumes of the fatal helmet which rose to the height of the windows waving backwards and forwards in a tempestuous manner and accompanied with a hollow and rustling sound isabella who gathered courage from her situation and who dreaded nothing so much as manfreds pursuit of his declaration cried,2
look my lord see heaven itself declares against your impious intentions,2
heaven nor hell shall impede my designs said manfred advancing again to seize the princess,2
at that instant the portrait of his grandfather which hung over the bench where they had been sitting uttered a deep sigh and heaved its breast,2
isabella whose back was turned to the picture saw not the motion nor knew whence the sound came but started and said,2
hark my lord what sound was that and at the same time made towards the door,2
manfred distracted between the flight of isabella who had now reached the stairs and yet unable to keep his eyes from the picture which began to move had however advanced some steps after her still looking backwards on the portrait when he saw it quit its panel and descend on the floor with a grave and melancholy air,2
do i dream cried manfred returning or are the devils themselves in league against me speak infernal spectre or if thou art my grandsire why dost thou too conspire against thy wretched descendant who too dearly pays for ere he could finish the sentence the vision sighed again and made a sign to manfred to follow him,2
lead on cried manfred i will follow thee to the gulf of perdition,2
the spectre marched sedately but dejected to the end of the gallery and turned into a chamber on the right hand manfred accompanied him at a little distance full of anxiety and horror but resolved as he would have entered the chamber the door was clapped to with violence by an invisible hand the prince collecting courage from this delay would have forcibly burst open the door with his foot but found that it resisted his utmost efforts,2
since hell will not satisfy my curiosity said manfred i will use the human means in my power for preserving my race isabella shall not escape me,2
the lady whose resolution had given way to terror the moment she had quitted manfred continued her flight to the bottom of the principal staircase there she stopped not knowing whither to direct her steps nor how to escape from the impetuosity of the prince the gates of the castle she knew were locked and guards placed in the court should she as her heart prompted her go and prepare hippolita for the cruel destiny that awaited her she did not doubt but manfred would seek her there and that his violence would incite him to double the injury he meditated without leaving room for them to avoid the impetuosity of his passions delay might give him time to reflect on the horrid measures he had conceived or produce some circumstance in her favour if she couldfor that night at leastavoid his odious purpose yet where conceal herself how avoid the pursuit he would infallibly make throughout the castle,2
as these thoughts passed rapidly through her mind she recollected a subterraneous passage which led from the vaults of the castle to the church of st nicholas could she reach the altar before she was overtaken she knew even manfreds violence would not dare to profane the sacredness of the place and she determined if no other means of deliverance offered to shut herself up for ever among the holy virgins whose convent was contiguous to the cathedral in this resolution she seized a lamp that burned at the foot of the staircase and hurried towards the secret passage,2
the lower part of the castle was hollowed into several intricate cloisters and it was not easy for one under so much anxiety to find the door that opened into the cavern an awful silence reigned throughout those subterraneous regions except now and then some blasts of wind that shook the doors she had passed and which grating on the rusty hinges were reechoed through that long labyrinth of darkness every murmur struck her with new terror yet more she dreaded to hear the wrathful voice of manfred urging his domestics to pursue her,2
she trod as softly as impatience would give her leave yet frequently stopped and listened to hear if she was followed in one of those moments she thought she heard a sigh she shuddered and recoiled a few paces in a moment she thought she heard the step of some person her blood curdled she concluded it was manfred every suggestion that horror could inspire rushed into her mind she condemned her rash flight which had thus exposed her to his rage in a place where her cries were not likely to draw anybody to her assistance yet the sound seemed not to come from behind if manfred knew where she was he must have followed her she was still in one of the cloisters and the steps she had heard were too distinct to proceed from the way she had come cheered with this reflection and hoping to find a friend in whoever was not the prince she was going to advance when a door that stood ajar at some distance to the left was opened gently but ere her lamp which she held up could discover who opened it the person retreated precipitately on seeing the light,2
isabella whom every incident was sufficient to dismay hesitated whether she should proceed her dread of manfred soon outweighed every other terror the very circumstance of the person avoiding her gave her a sort of courage it could only be she thought some domestic belonging to the castle her gentleness had never raised her an enemy and conscious innocence made her hope that unless sent by the princes order to seek her his servants would rather assist than prevent her flight fortifying herself with these reflections and believing by what she could observe that she was near the mouth of the subterraneous cavern she approached the door that had been opened but a sudden gust of wind that met her at the door extinguished her lamp and left her in total darkness,2
words cannot paint the horror of the princesss situation alone in so dismal a place her mind imprinted with all the terrible events of the day hopeless of escaping expecting every moment the arrival of manfred and far from tranquil on knowing she was within reach of somebody she knew not whom who for some cause seemed concealed thereabouts all these thoughts crowded on her distracted mind and she was ready to sink under her apprehensions she addressed herself to every saint in heaven and inwardly implored their assistance for a considerable time she remained in an agony of despair,2
at last as softly as was possible she felt for the door and having found it entered trembling into the vault from whence she had heard the sigh and steps it gave her a kind of momentary joy to perceive an imperfect ray of clouded moonshine gleam from the roof of the vault which seemed to be fallen in and from whence hung a fragment of earth or building she could not distinguish which that appeared to have been crushed inwards she advanced eagerly towards this chasm when she discerned a human form standing close against the wall,2
she shrieked believing it the ghost of her betrothed conrad the figure advancing said in a submissive voice,2
isabella a little encouraged by the words and tone of voice of the stranger and recollecting that this must be the person who had opened the door recovered her spirits enough to reply,2
sir whoever you are take pity on a wretched princess standing on the brink of destruction assist me to escape from this fatal castle or in a few moments i may be made miserable for ever,2
alas said the stranger what can i do to assist you i will die in your defence but i am unacquainted with the castle and want,2
oh said isabella hastily interrupting him help me but to find a trapdoor that must be hereabout and it is the greatest service you can do me for i have not a minute to lose,2
saying these words she felt about on the pavement and directed the stranger to search likewise for a smooth piece of brass enclosed in one of the stones,2
that said she is the lock which opens with a spring of which i know the secret if we can find that i may escapeif not alas courteous stranger i fear i shall have involved you in my misfortunes manfred will suspect you for the accomplice of my flight and you will fall a victim to his resentment,2
i value not my life said the stranger and it will be some comfort to lose it in trying to deliver you from his tyranny,2
as she uttered those words a ray of moonshine streaming through a cranny of the ruin above shone directly on the lock they sought,2
oh transport said isabella here is the trapdoor and taking out the key she touched the spring which starting aside discovered an iron ring lift up the door said the princess,2
the stranger obeyed and beneath appeared some stone steps descending into a vault totally dark,2
we must go down here said isabella follow me dark and dismal as it is we cannot miss our way it leads directly to the church of st nicholas but perhaps added the princess modestly you have no reason to leave the castle nor have i farther occasion for your service in a few minutes i shall be safe from manfreds rageonly let me know to whom i am so much obliged,2
i will never quit you said the stranger eagerly until i have placed you in safetynor think me princess more generous than i am though you are my principal care,2
the stranger was interrupted by a sudden noise of voices that seemed approaching and they soon distinguished these words,2
talk not to me of necromancers i tell you she must be in the castle i will find her in spite of enchantment,2
oh heavens cried isabella it is the voice of manfred make haste or we are ruined and shut the trapdoor after you,2
saying this she descended the steps precipitately and as the stranger hastened to follow her he let the door slip out of his hands it fell and the spring closed over it he tried in vain to open it not having observed isabellas method of touching the spring nor had he many moments to make an essay the noise of the falling door had been heard by manfred who directed by the sound hastened thither attended by his servants with torches,2
it must be isabella cried manfred before he entered the vault she is escaping by the subterraneous passage but she cannot have got far,2
what was the astonishment of the prince when instead of isabella the light of the torches discovered to him the young peasant whom he thought confined under the fatal helmet,2
traitor said manfred how camest thou here i thought thee in durance above in the court,2
i am no traitor replied the young man boldly nor am i answerable for your thoughts,2
presumptuous villain cried manfred dost thou provoke my wrath tell me how hast thou escaped from above thou hast corrupted thy guards and their lives shall answer it,2
my poverty said the peasant calmly will disculpate them though the ministers of a tyrants wrath to thee they are faithful and but too willing to execute the orders which you unjustly imposed upon them,2
art thou so hardy as to dare my vengeance said the prince but tortures shall force the truth from thee tell me i will know thy accomplices,2
there was my accomplice said the youth smiling and pointing to the roof,2
manfred ordered the torches to be held up and perceived that one of the cheeks of the enchanted casque had forced its way through the pavement of the court as his servants had let it fall over the peasant and had broken through into the vault leaving a gap through which the peasant had pressed himself some minutes before he was found by isabella,2
was that the way by which thou didst descend said manfred,2
but what noise was that said manfred which i heard as i entered the cloister,2
a door clapped said the peasant i heard it as well as you,2
i am not acquainted with your castle said the peasant this is the first time i ever entered it and this vault the only part of it within which i ever was,2
but i tell thee said manfred wishing to find out if the youth had discovered the trapdoor it was this way i heard the noise my servants heard it too,2
my lord interrupted one of them officiously to be sure it was the trapdoor and he was going to make his escape,2
peace blockhead said the prince angrily if he was going to escape how should he come on this side i will know from his own mouth what noise it was i heard tell me truly thy life depends on thy veracity,2
my veracity is dearer to me than my life said the peasant nor would i purchase the one by forfeiting the other,2
indeed young philosopher said manfred contemptuously tell me then what was the noise i heard,2
ask me what i can answer said he and put me to death instantly if i tell you a lie,2
manfred growing impatient at the steady valour and indifference of the youth cried,2
well then thou man of truth answer was it the fall of the trapdoor that i heard,2
it was said the prince and how didst thou come to know there was a trapdoor here,2
i saw the plate of brass by a gleam of moonshine replied he,2
but what told thee it was a lock said manfred how didst thou discover the secret of opening it,2
providence that delivered me from the helmet was able to direct me to the spring of a lock said he,2
providence should have gone a little farther and have placed thee out of the reach of my resentment said manfred when providence had taught thee to open the lock it abandoned thee for a fool who did not know how to make use of its favours why didst thou not pursue the path pointed out for thy escape why didst thou shut the trapdoor before thou hadst descended the steps,2
i might ask you my lord said the peasant how i totally unacquainted with your castle was to know that those steps led to any outlet but i scorn to evade your questions wherever those steps lead to perhaps i should have explored the wayi could not be in a worse situation than i was but the truth is i let the trapdoor fall your immediate arrival followed i had given the alarmwhat imported it to me whether i was seized a minute sooner or a minute later,2
thou art a resolute villain for thy years said manfred yet on reflection i suspect thou dost but trifle with me thou hast not yet told me how thou didst open the lock,2
that i will show you my lord said the peasant and taking up a fragment of stone that had fallen from above he laid himself on the trapdoor and began to beat on the piece of brass that covered it meaning to gain time for the escape of the princess this presence of mind joined to the frankness of the youth staggered manfred he even felt a disposition towards pardoning one who had been guilty of no crime manfred was not one of those savage tyrants who wanton in cruelty unprovoked the circumstances of his fortune had given an asperity to his temper which was naturally humane and his virtues were always ready to operate when his passions did not obscure his reason,2
while the prince was in this suspense a confused noise of voices echoed through the distant vaults as the sound approached he distinguished the clamours of some of his domestics whom he had dispersed through the castle in search of isabella calling out,2
here i am said manfred as they came nearer have you found the princess,2
the first that arrived replied oh my lord i am glad we have found you,2
we thought we had my lord said the fellow looking terrified but,2
yes i and diego interrupted the second who came up in still greater consternation,2
speak one of you at a time said manfred i ask you where is the princess,2
we do not know said they both together but we are frightened out of our wits,2
so i think blockheads said manfred what is it has scared you thus,2
oh my lord said jaquez diego has seen such a sight your highness would not believe our eyes,2
what new absurdity is this cried manfred give me a direct answer or by heaven,2
why my lord if it please your highness to hear me said the poor fellow diego and i,2
did not i forbid you to speak both at a time said the prince you jaquez answer for the other fool seems more distracted than thou art what is the matter,2
my gracious lord said jaquez if it please your highness to hear me diego and i according to your highnesss orders went to search for the young lady but being comprehensive that we might meet the ghost of my young lord your highnesss son god rest his soul as he has not received christian burial,2
sot cried manfred in a rage is it only a ghost then that thou hast seen,2
oh worse worse my lord cried diego i had rather have seen ten whole ghosts,2
grant me patience said manfred these blockheads distract me out of my sight diego and thou jaquez tell me in one word art thou sober art thou raving thou wast wont to have some sense has the other sot frightened himself and thee too speak what is it he fancies he has seen,2
why my lord replied jaquez trembling i was going to tell your highness that since the calamitous misfortune of my young lord god rest his precious soul not one of us your highnesss faithful servantsindeed we are my lord though poor meni say not one of us has dared to set a foot about the castle but two together so diego and i thinking that my young lady might be in the great gallery went up there to look for her and tell her your highness wanted something to impart to her,2
o blundering fools cried manfred and in the meantime she has made her escape because you were afraid of goblinswhy thou knave she left me in the gallery i came from thence myself,2
for all that she may be there still for aught i know said jaquez but the devil shall have me before i seek her there againpoor diego i do not believe he will ever recover it,2
recover what said manfred am i never to learn what it is has terrified these rascalsbut i lose my time follow me slave i will see if she is in the gallery,2
for heavens sake my dear good lord cried jaquez do not go to the gallery satan himself i believe is in the chamber next to the gallery,2
manfred who hitherto had treated the terror of his servants as an idle panic was struck at this new circumstance he recollected the apparition of the portrait and the sudden closing of the door at the end of the gallery his voice faltered and he asked with disorder,2
my lord said jaquez when diego and i came into the gallery he went first for he said he had more courage than i so when we came into the gallery we found nobody we looked under every bench and stool and still we found nobody,2
yes my lord answered jaquez but we did not think of looking behind them,2
when we came to the door of the great chamber continued jaquez we found it shut,2
oh yes my lord would to heaven we had not replied henay it was not i neither it was diego he was grown foolhardy and would go on though i advised him notif ever i open a door that is shut again,2
trifle not said manfred shuddering but tell me what you saw in the great chamber on opening the door,2
i my lord said jaquez i was behind diego but i heard the noise,2
jaquez said manfred in a solemn tone of voice tell me i adjure thee by the souls of my ancestors what was it thou sawest what was it thou heardest,2
it was diego saw it my lord it was not i replied jaquez i only heard the noise diego had no sooner opened the door than he cried out and ran back i ran back too and said is it the ghost the ghost no no said diego and his hair stood on endit is a giant i believe he is all clad in armour for i saw his foot and part of his leg and they are as large as the helmet below in the court as he said these words my lord we heard a violent motion and the rattling of armour as if the giant was rising for diego has told me since that he believes the giant was lying down for the foot and leg were stretched at length on the floor before we could get to the end of the gallery we heard the door of the great chamber clap behind us but we did not dare turn back to see if the giant was following usyet now i think on it we must have heard him if he had pursued usbut for heavens sake good my lord send for the chaplain and have the castle exorcised for for certain it is enchanted,2
ay pray do my lord cried all the servants at once or we must leave your highnesss service,2
peace dotards said manfred and follow me i will know what all this means,2
we my lord cried they with one voice we would not go up to the gallery for your highnesss revenue the young peasant who had stood silent now spoke,2
will your highness said he permit me to try this adventure my life is of consequence to nobody i fear no bad angel and have offended no good one,2
your behaviour is above your seeming said manfred viewing him with surprise and admirationhereafter i will reward your braverybut now continued he with a sigh i am so circumstanced that i dare trust no eyes but my own however i give you leave to accompany me,2
manfred when he first followed isabella from the gallery had gone directly to the apartment of his wife concluding the princess had retired thither hippolita who knew his step rose with anxious fondness to meet her lord whom she had not seen since the death of their son she would have flown in a transport mixed of joy and grief to his bosom but he pushed her rudely off and said,2
my lord replied matilda who perceived how much his behaviour had shocked her mother she has not been with us since your highness summoned her to your apartment,2
tell me where she is said the prince i do not want to know where she has been,2
my good lord says hippolita your daughter tells you the truth isabella left us by your command and has not returned sincebut my good lord compose yourself retire to your rest this dismal day has disordered you isabella shall wait your orders in the morning,2
what then you know where she is cried manfred tell me directly for i will not lose an instantand you woman speaking to his wife order your chaplain to attend me forthwith,2
isabella said hippolita calmly is retired i suppose to her chamber she is not accustomed to watch at this late hour gracious my lord continued she let me know what has disturbed you has isabella offended you,2
trouble me not with questions said manfred but tell me where she is,2
matilda shall call her said the princess sit down my lord and resume your wonted fortitude,2
what art thou jealous of isabella replied he that you wish to be present at our interview,2
good heavens my lord said hippolita what is it your highness means,2
thou wilt know ere many minutes are passed said the cruel prince send your chaplain to me and wait my pleasure here,2
at these words he flung out of the room in search of isabella leaving the amazed ladies thunderstruck with his words and frantic deportment and lost in vain conjectures on what he was meditating,2
manfred was now returning from the vault attended by the peasant and a few of his servants whom he had obliged to accompany him he ascended the staircase without stopping till he arrived at the gallery at the door of which he met hippolita and her chaplain when diego had been dismissed by manfred he had gone directly to the princesss apartment with the alarm of what he had seen that excellent lady who no more than manfred doubted of the reality of the vision yet affected to treat it as a delirium of the servant willing however to save her lord from any additional shock and prepared by a series of griefs not to tremble at any accession to it she determined to make herself the first sacrifice if fate had marked the present hour for their destruction dismissing the reluctant matilda to her rest who in vain sued for leave to accompany her mother and attended only by her chaplain hippolita had visited the gallery and great chamber and now with more serenity of soul than she had felt for many hours she met her lord and assured him that the vision of the gigantic leg and foot was all a fable and no doubt an impression made by fear and the dark and dismal hour of the night on the minds of his servants she and the chaplain had examined the chamber and found everything in the usual order,2
manfred though persuaded like his wife that the vision had been no work of fancy recovered a little from the tempest of mind into which so many strange events had thrown him ashamed too of his inhuman treatment of a princess who returned every injury with new marks of tenderness and duty he felt returning love forcing itself into his eyes but not less ashamed of feeling remorse towards one against whom he was inwardly meditating a yet more bitter outrage he curbed the yearnings of his heart and did not dare to lean even towards pity the next transition of his soul was to exquisite villainy,2
presuming on the unshaken submission of hippolita he flattered himself that she would not only acquiesce with patience to a divorce but would obey if it was his pleasure in endeavouring to persuade isabella to give him her handbut ere he could indulge his horrid hope he reflected that isabella was not to be found coming to himself he gave orders that every avenue to the castle should be strictly guarded and charged his domestics on pain of their lives to suffer nobody to pass out the young peasant to whom he spoke favourably he ordered to remain in a small chamber on the stairs in which there was a palletbed and the key of which he took away himself telling the youth he would talk with him in the morning then dismissing his attendants and bestowing a sullen kind of halfnod on hippolita he retired to his own chamber,2
matilda who by hippolitas order had retired to her apartment was illdisposed to take any rest the shocking fate of her brother had deeply affected her she was surprised at not seeing isabella but the strange words which had fallen from her father and his obscure menace to the princess his wife accompanied by the most furious behaviour had filled her gentle mind with terror and alarm she waited anxiously for the return of bianca a young damsel that attended her whom she had sent to learn what was become of isabella bianca soon appeared and informed her mistress of what she had gathered from the servants that isabella was nowhere to be found she related the adventure of the young peasant who had been discovered in the vault though with many simple additions from the incoherent accounts of the domestics and she dwelt principally on the gigantic leg and foot which had been seen in the gallerychamber this last circumstance had terrified bianca so much that she was rejoiced when matilda told her that she would not go to rest but would watch till the princess should rise,2
the young princess wearied herself in conjectures on the flight of isabella and on the threats of manfred to her mother but what business could he have so urgent with the chaplain said matilda does he intend to have my brothers body interred privately in the chapel,2
oh madam said bianca now i guess as you are become his heiress he is impatient to have you married he has always been raving for more sons i warrant he is now impatient for grandsons as sure as i live madam i shall see you a bride at lastgood madam you wont cast off your faithful bianca you wont put donna rosara over me now you are a great princess,2
my poor bianca said matilda how fast your thoughts amble i a great princess what hast thou seen in manfreds behaviour since my brothers death that bespeaks any increase of tenderness to me no bianca his heart was ever a stranger to mebut he is my father and i must not complain nay if heaven shuts my fathers heart against me it overpays my little merit in the tenderness of my mothero that dear mother yes bianca tis there i feel the rugged temper of manfred i can support his harshness to me with patience but it wounds my soul when i am witness to his causeless severity towards her,2
oh madam said bianca all men use their wives so when they are weary of them,2
and yet you congratulated me but now said matilda when you fancied my father intended to dispose of me,2
i would have you a great lady replied bianca come what will i do not wish to see you moped in a convent as you would be if you had your will and if my lady your mother who knows that a bad husband is better than no husband at all did not hinder youbless me what noise is that st nicholas forgive me i was but in jest,2
it is the wind said matilda whistling through the battlements in the tower above you have heard it a thousand times,2
nay said bianca there was no harm neither in what i said it is no sin to talk of matrimonyand so madam as i was saying if my lord manfred should offer you a handsome young prince for a bridegroom you would drop him a curtsey and tell him you would rather take the veil,2
thank heaven i am in no such danger said matilda you know how many proposals for me he has rejected,2
and you thank him like a dutiful daughter do you madam but come madam suppose tomorrow morning he was to send for you to the great council chamber and there you should find at his elbow a lovely young prince with large black eyes a smooth white forehead and manly curling locks like jet in short madam a young hero resembling the picture of the good alfonso in the gallery which you sit and gaze at for hours together,2
do not speak lightly of that picture interrupted matilda sighing i know the adoration with which i look at that picture is uncommonbut i am not in love with a coloured panel the character of that virtuous prince the veneration with which my mother has inspired me for his memory the orisons which i know not why she has enjoined me to pour forth at his tomb all have concurred to persuade me that somehow or other my destiny is linked with something relating to him,2
lord madam how should that be said bianca i have always heard that your family was in no way related to his and i am sure i cannot conceive why my lady the princess sends you in a cold morning or a damp evening to pray at his tomb he is no saint by the almanack if you must pray why does she not bid you address yourself to our great st nicholas i am sure he is the saint i pray to for a husband,2
perhaps my mind would be less affected said matilda if my mother would explain her reasons to me but it is the mystery she observes that inspires me with thisi know not what to call it as she never acts from caprice i am sure there is some fatal secret at bottomnay i know there is in her agony of grief for my brothers death she dropped some words that intimated as much,2
no said matilda if a parent lets fall a word and wishes it recalled it is not for a child to utter it,2
what was she sorry for what she had said asked bianca i am sure madam you may trust me,2
with my own little secrets when i have any i may said matilda but never with my mothers a child ought to have no ears or eyes but as a parent directs,2
well to be sure madam you were born to be a saint said bianca and there is no resisting ones vocation you will end in a convent at last but there is my lady isabella would not be so reserved to me she will let me talk to her of young men and when a handsome cavalier has come to the castle she has owned to me that she wished your brother conrad resembled him,2
bianca said the princess i do not allow you to mention my friend disrespectfully isabella is of a cheerful disposition but her soul is pure as virtue itself she knows your idle babbling humour and perhaps has now and then encouraged it to divert melancholy and enliven the solitude in which my father keeps us,2
blessed mary said bianca starting there it is again dear madam do you hear nothing this castle is certainly haunted,2
peace said matilda and listen i did think i heard a voicebut it must be fancy your terrors i suppose have infected me,2
indeed indeed madam said bianca halfweeping with agony i am sure i heard a voice,2
does anybody lie in the chamber beneath said the princess,2
nobody has dared to lie there answered bianca since the great astrologer that was your brothers tutor drowned himself for certain madam his ghost and the young princes are now met in the chamber belowfor heavens sake let us fly to your mothers apartment,2
i charge you not to stir said matilda if they are spirits in pain we may ease their sufferings by questioning them they can mean no hurt to us for we have not injured themand if they should shall we be more safe in one chamber than in another reach me my beads we will say a prayer and then speak to them,2
oh dear lady i would not speak to a ghost for the world cried bianca as she said those words they heard the casement of the little chamber below matildas open they listened attentively and in a few minutes thought they heard a person sing but could not distinguish the words,2
this can be no evil spirit said the princess in a low voice it is undoubtedly one of the familyopen the window and we shall know the voice,2
thou art a very fool said matilda opening the window gently herself the noise the princess made was however heard by the person beneath who stopped and they concluded had heard the casement open,2
is anybody below said the princess if there is speak,2
what stranger said she and how didst thou come there at this unusual hour when all the gates of the castle are locked,2
i am not here willingly answered the voice but pardon me lady if i have disturbed your rest i knew not that i was overheard sleep had forsaken me i left a restless couch and came to waste the irksome hours with gazing on the fair approach of morning impatient to be dismissed from this castle,2
thy words and accents said matilda are of melancholy cast if thou art unhappy i pity thee if poverty afflicts thee let me know it i will mention thee to the princess whose beneficent soul ever melts for the distressed and she will relieve thee,2
i am indeed unhappy said the stranger and i know not what wealth is but i do not complain of the lot which heaven has cast for me i am young and healthy and am not ashamed of owing my support to myselfyet think me not proud or that i disdain your generous offers i will remember you in my orisons and will pray for blessings on your gracious self and your noble mistressif i sigh lady it is for others not for myself,2
now i have it madam said bianca whispering the princess this is certainly the young peasant and by my conscience he is in lovewell this is a charming adventuredo madam let us sift him he does not know you but takes you for one of my lady hippolitas women,2
art thou not ashamed bianca said the princess what right have we to pry into the secrets of this young mans heart he seems virtuous and frank and tells us he is unhappy are those circumstances that authorise us to make a property of him how are we entitled to his confidence,2
lord madam how little you know of love replied bianca why lovers have no pleasure equal to talking of their mistress,2
and would you have me become a peasants confidante said the princess,2
well then let me talk to him said bianca though i have the honour of being your highnesss maid of honour i was not always so great besides if love levels ranks it raises them too i have a respect for any young man in love,2
peace simpleton said the princess though he said he was unhappy it does not follow that he must be in love think of all that has happened today and tell me if there are no misfortunes but what love causesstranger resumed the princess if thy misfortunes have not been occasioned by thy own fault and are within the compass of the princess hippolitas power to redress i will take upon me to answer that she will be thy protectress when thou art dismissed from this castle repair to holy father jerome at the convent adjoining to the church of st nicholas and make thy story known to him as far as thou thinkest meet he will not fail to inform the princess who is the mother of all that want her assistance farewell it is not seemly for me to hold farther converse with a man at this unwonted hour,2
may the saints guard thee gracious lady replied the peasant but oh if a poor and worthless stranger might presume to beg a minutes audience farther am i so happy the casement is not shut might i venture to ask,2
speak quickly said matilda the morning dawns apace should the labourers come into the fields and perceive uswhat wouldst thou ask,2
i know not how i know not if i dare said the young stranger faltering yet the humanity with which you have spoken to me emboldenslady dare i trust you,2
heavens said matilda what dost thou mean with what wouldst thou trust me speak boldly if thy secret is fit to be entrusted to a virtuous breast,2
i would ask said the peasant recollecting himself whether what i have heard from the domestics is true that the princess is missing from the castle,2
what imports it to thee to know replied matilda thy first words bespoke a prudent and becoming gravity dost thou come hither to pry into the secrets of manfred adieu i have been mistaken in thee saying these words she shut the casement hastily without giving the young man time to reply,2
i had acted more wisely said the princess to bianca with some sharpness if i had let thee converse with this peasant his inquisitiveness seems of a piece with thy own,2
it is not fit for me to argue with your highness replied bianca but perhaps the questions i should have put to him would have been more to the purpose than those you have been pleased to ask him,2
oh no doubt said matilda you are a very discreet personage may i know what you would have asked him,2
a bystander often sees more of the game than those that play answered bianca does your highness think madam that this question about my lady isabella was the result of mere curiosity no no madam there is more in it than you great folks are aware of lopez told me that all the servants believe this young fellow contrived my lady isabellas escape now pray madam observe you and i both know that my lady isabella never much fancied the prince your brother well he is killed just in a critical minutei accuse nobody a helmet falls from the moonso my lord your father says but lopez and all the servants say that this young spark is a magician and stole it from alfonsos tomb,2
nay madam as you please cried bianca yet it is very particular though that my lady isabella should be missing the very same day and that this young sorcerer should be found at the mouth of the trapdoor i accuse nobody but if my young lord came honestly by his death,2
dare not on thy duty said matilda to breathe a suspicion on the purity of my dear isabellas fame,2
purity or not purity said bianca gone she isa stranger is found that nobody knows you question him yourself he tells you he is in love or unhappy it is the same thingnay he owned he was unhappy about others and is anybody unhappy about another unless they are in love with them and at the very next word he asks innocently pour soul if my lady isabella is missing,2
to be sure said matilda thy observations are not totally without foundationisabellas flight amazes me the curiosity of the stranger is very particular yet isabella never concealed a thought from me,2
so she told you said bianca to fish out your secrets but who knows madam but this stranger may be some prince in disguise do madam let me open the window and ask him a few questions,2
no replied matilda i will ask him myself if he knows aught of isabella he is not worthy i should converse farther with him she was going to open the casement when they heard the bell ring at the posterngate of the castle which is on the right hand of the tower where matilda lay this prevented the princess from renewing the conversation with the stranger,2
after continuing silent for some time i am persuaded said she to bianca that whatever be the cause of isabellas flight it had no unworthy motive if this stranger was accessory to it she must be satisfied with his fidelity and worth i observed did not you bianca that his words were tinctured with an uncommon infusion of piety it was no ruffians speech his phrases were becoming a man of gentle birth,2
i told you madam said bianca that i was sure he was some prince in disguise,2
yet said matilda if he was privy to her escape how will you account for his not accompanying her in her flight why expose himself unnecessarily and rashly to my fathers resentment,2
as for that madam replied she if he could get from under the helmet he will find ways of eluding your fathers anger i do not doubt but he has some talisman or other about him,2
you resolve everything into magic said matilda but a man who has any intercourse with infernal spirits does not dare to make use of those tremendous and holy words which he uttered didst thou not observe with what fervour he vowed to remember me to heaven in his prayers yes isabella was undoubtedly convinced of his piety,2
commend me to the piety of a young fellow and a damsel that consult to elope said bianca no no madam my lady isabella is of another guess mould than you take her for she used indeed to sigh and lift up her eyes in your company because she knows you are a saint but when your back was turned,2
you wrong her said matilda isabella is no hypocrite she has a due sense of devotion but never affected a call she has not on the contrary she always combated my inclination for the cloister and though i own the mystery she has made to me of her flight confounds me though it seems inconsistent with the friendship between us i cannot forget the disinterested warmth with which she always opposed my taking the veil she wished to see me married though my dower would have been a loss to her and my brothers children for her sake i will believe well of this young peasant,2
then you do think there is some liking between them said bianca while she was speaking a servant came hastily into the chamber and told the princess that the lady isabella was found,2
she has taken sanctuary in st nicholass church replied the servant father jerome has brought the news himself he is below with his highness,2
she is in her own chamber madam and has asked for you,2
manfred had risen at the first dawn of light and gone to hippolitas apartment to inquire if she knew aught of isabella while he was questioning her word was brought that jerome demanded to speak with him manfred little suspecting the cause of the friars arrival and knowing he was employed by hippolita in her charities ordered him to be admitted intending to leave them together while he pursued his search after isabella,2
is your business with me or the princess said manfred,2
that is no business of hippolita said manfred with confusion let us retire to my chamber father and inform me how she came thither,2
no my lord replied the good man with an air of firmness and authority that daunted even the resolute manfred who could not help revering the saintlike virtues of jerome my commission is to both and with your highnesss goodliking in the presence of both i shall deliver it but first my lord i must interrogate the princess whether she is acquainted with the cause of the lady isabellas retirement from your castle,2
no on my soul said hippolita does isabella charge me with being privy to it,2
father interrupted manfred i pay due reverence to your holy profession but i am sovereign here and will allow no meddling priest to interfere in the affairs of my domestic if you have aught to say attend me to my chamber i do not use to let my wife be acquainted with the secret affairs of my state they are not within a womans province,2
my lord said the holy man i am no intruder into the secrets of families my office is to promote peace to heal divisions to preach repentance and teach mankind to curb their headstrong passions i forgive your highnesss uncharitable apostrophe i know my duty and am the minister of a mightier prince than manfred hearken to him who speaks through my organs,2
manfred trembled with rage and shame hippolitas countenance declared her astonishment and impatience to know where this would end her silence more strongly spoke her observance of manfred,2
the lady isabella resumed jerome commends herself to both your highnesses she thanks both for the kindness with which she has been treated in your castle she deplores the loss of your son and her own misfortune in not becoming the daughter of such wise and noble princes whom she shall always respect as parents she prays for uninterrupted union and felicity between you manfreds colour changed but as it is no longer possible for her to be allied to you she entreats your consent to remain in sanctuary till she can learn news of her father or by the certainty of his death be at liberty with the approbation of her guardians to dispose of herself in suitable marriage,2
i shall give no such consent said the prince but insist on her return to the castle without delay i am answerable for her person to her guardians and will not brook her being in any hands but my own,2
your highness will recollect whether that can any longer be proper replied the friar,2
i want no monitor said manfred colouring isabellas conduct leaves room for strange suspicionsand that young villain who was at least the accomplice of her flight if not the cause of it,2
the cause interrupted jerome was a young man the cause,2
this is not to be borne cried manfred am i to be bearded in my own palace by an insolent monk thou art privy i guess to their amours,2
i would pray to heaven to clear up your uncharitable surmises said jerome if your highness were not satisfied in your conscience how unjustly you accuse me i do pray to heaven to pardon that uncharitableness and i implore your highness to leave the princess at peace in that holy place where she is not liable to be disturbed by such vain and worldly fantasies as discourses of love from any man,2
cant not to me said manfred but return and bring the princess to her duty,2
it is my duty to prevent her return hither said jerome she is where orphans and virgins are safest from the snares and wiles of this world and nothing but a parents authority shall take her thence,2
she wished to have you for her parent said the friar but heaven that forbad that connection has for ever dissolved all ties betwixt you and i announce to your highness,2
holy father said hippolita it is your office to be no respecter of persons you must speak as your duty prescribes but it is my duty to hear nothing that it pleases not my lord i should hear attend the prince to his chamber i will retire to my oratory and pray to the blessed virgin to inspire you with her holy counsels and to restore the heart of my gracious lord to its wonted peace and gentleness,2
excellent woman said the friar my lord i attend your pleasure,2
manfred accompanied by the friar passed to his own apartment where shutting the door i perceive father said he that isabella has acquainted you with my purpose now hear my resolve and obey reasons of state most urgent reasons my own and the safety of my people demand that i should have a son it is in vain to expect an heir from hippolita i have made choice of isabella you must bring her back and you must do more i know the influence you have with hippolita her conscience is in your hands she is i allow a faultless woman her soul is set on heaven and scorns the little grandeur of this world you can withdraw her from it entirely persuade her to consent to the dissolution of our marriage and to retire into a monasteryshe shall endow one if she will and she shall have the means of being as liberal to your order as she or you can wish thus you will divert the calamities that are hanging over our heads and have the merit of saving the principality of otranto from destruction you are a prudent man and though the warmth of my temper betrayed me into some unbecoming expressions i honour your virtue and wish to be indebted to you for the repose of my life and the preservation of my family,2
the will of heaven be done said the friar i am but its worthless instrument it makes use of my tongue to tell thee prince of thy unwarrantable designs the injuries of the virtuous hippolita have mounted to the throne of pity by me thou art reprimanded for thy adulterous intention of repudiating her by me thou art warned not to pursue the incestuous design on thy contracted daughter heaven that delivered her from thy fury when the judgments so recently fallen on thy house ought to have inspired thee with other thoughts will continue to watch over her even i a poor and despised friar am able to protect her from thy violencei sinner as i am and uncharitably reviled by your highness as an accomplice of i know not what amours scorn the allurements with which it has pleased thee to tempt mine honesty i love my order i honour devout souls i respect the piety of thy princessbut i will not betray the confidence she reposes in me nor serve even the cause of religion by foul and sinful compliancesbut forsooth the welfare of the state depends on your highness having a son heaven mocks the shortsighted views of man but yestermorn whose house was so great so flourishing as manfredswhere is young conrad nowmy lord i respect your tearsbut i mean not to check themlet them flow prince they will weigh more with heaven toward the welfare of thy subjects than a marriage which founded on lust or policy could never prosper the sceptre which passed from the race of alfonso to thine cannot be preserved by a match which the church will never allow if it is the will of the most high that manfreds name must perish resign yourself my lord to its decrees and thus deserve a crown that can never pass away come my lord i like this sorrowlet us return to the princess she is not apprised of your cruel intentions nor did i mean more than to alarm you you saw with what gentle patience with what efforts of love she heard she rejected hearing the extent of your guilt i know she longs to fold you in her arms and assure you of her unalterable affection,2
father said the prince you mistake my compunction true i honour hippolitas virtues i think her a saint and wish it were for my souls health to tie faster the knot that has united usbut alas father you know not the bitterest of my pangs it is some time that i have had scruples on the legality of our union hippolita is related to me in the fourth degreeit is true we had a dispensation but i have been informed that she had also been contracted to another this it is that sits heavy at my heart to this state of unlawful wedlock i impute the visitation that has fallen on me in the death of conradease my conscience of this burden dissolve our marriage and accomplish the work of godlinesswhich your divine exhortations have commenced in my soul,2
how cutting was the anguish which the good man felt when he perceived this turn in the wily prince he trembled for hippolita whose ruin he saw was determined and he feared if manfred had no hope of recovering isabella that his impatience for a son would direct him to some other object who might not be equally proof against the temptation of manfreds rank for some time the holy man remained absorbed in thought at length conceiving some hopes from delay he thought the wisest conduct would be to prevent the prince from despairing of recovering isabella her the friar knew he could dispose from her affection to hippolita and from the aversion she had expressed to him for manfreds addresses to second his views till the censures of the church could be fulminated against a divorce with this intention as if struck with the princes scruples he at length said,2
my lord i have been pondering on what your highness has said and if in truth it is delicacy of conscience that is the real motive of your repugnance to your virtuous lady far be it from me to endeavour to harden your heart the church is an indulgent mother unfold your griefs to her she alone can administer comfort to your soul either by satisfying your conscience or upon examination of your scruples by setting you at liberty and indulging you in the lawful means of continuing your lineage in the latter case if the lady isabella can be brought to consent,2
manfred who concluded that he had either overreached the good man or that his first warmth had been but a tribute paid to appearance was overjoyed at this sudden turn and repeated the most magnificent promises if he should succeed by the friars mediation the wellmeaning priest suffered him to deceive himself fully determined to traverse his views instead of seconding them,2
since we now understand one another resumed the prince i expect father that you satisfy me in one point who is the youth that i found in the vault he must have been privy to isabellas flight tell me truly is he her lover or is he an agent for anothers passion i have often suspected isabellas indifference to my son a thousand circumstances crowd on my mind that confirm that suspicion she herself was so conscious of it that while i discoursed her in the gallery she outran my suspicions and endeavoured to justify herself from coolness to conrad,2
the friar who knew nothing of the youth but what he had learnt occasionally from the princess ignorant what was become of him and not sufficiently reflecting on the impetuosity of manfreds temper conceived that it might not be amiss to sow the seeds of jealousy in his mind they might be turned to some use hereafter either by prejudicing the prince against isabella if he persisted in that union or by diverting his attention to a wrong scent and employing his thoughts on a visionary intrigue prevent his engaging in any new pursuit with this unhappy policy he answered in a manner to confirm manfred in the belief of some connection between isabella and the youth the prince whose passions wanted little fuel to throw them into a blaze fell into a rage at the idea of what the friar suggested,2
i will fathom to the bottom of this intrigue cried he and quitting jerome abruptly with a command to remain there till his return he hastened to the great hall of the castle and ordered the peasant to be brought before him,2
thou hardened young impostor said the prince as soon as he saw the youth what becomes of thy boasted veracity now it was providence was it and the light of the moon that discovered the lock of the trapdoor to thee tell me audacious boy who thou art and how long thou hast been acquainted with the princessand take care to answer with less equivocation than thou didst last night or tortures shall wring the truth from thee,2
the young man perceiving that his share in the flight of the princess was discovered and concluding that anything he should say could no longer be of any service or detriment to her replied,2
i am no impostor my lord nor have i deserved opprobrious language i answered to every question your highness put to me last night with the same veracity that i shall speak now and that will not be from fear of your tortures but because my soul abhors a falsehood please to repeat your questions my lord i am ready to give you all the satisfaction in my power,2
you know my questions replied the prince and only want time to prepare an evasion speak directly who art thou and how long hast thou been known to the princess,2
i am a labourer at the next village said the peasant my name is theodore the princess found me in the vault last night before that hour i never was in her presence,2
i may believe as much or as little as i please of this said manfred but i will hear thy own story before i examine into the truth of it tell me what reason did the princess give thee for making her escape thy life depends on thy answer,2
she told me replied theodore that she was on the brink of destruction and that if she could not escape from the castle she was in danger in a few moments of being made miserable for ever,2
and on this slight foundation on a silly girls report said manfred thou didst hazard my displeasure,2
i fear no mans displeasure said theodore when a woman in distress puts herself under my protection,2
during this examination matilda was going to the apartment of hippolita at the upper end of the hall where manfred sat was a boarded gallery with latticed windows through which matilda and bianca were to pass hearing her fathers voice and seeing the servants assembled round him she stopped to learn the occasion the prisoner soon drew her attention the steady and composed manner in which he answered and the gallantry of his last reply which were the first words she heard distinctly interested her in his favour his person was noble handsome and commanding even in that situation but his countenance soon engrossed her whole care,2
heavens bianca said the princess softly do i dream or is not that youth the exact resemblance of alfonsos picture in the gallery,2
she could say no more for her fathers voice grew louder at every word,2
this bravado said he surpasses all thy former insolence thou shalt experience the wrath with which thou darest to trifle seize him continued manfred and bind himthe first news the princess hears of her champion shall be that he has lost his head for her sake,2
the injustice of which thou art guilty towards me said theodore convinces me that i have done a good deed in delivering the princess from thy tyranny may she be happy whatever becomes of me,2
this is a lover cried manfred in a rage a peasant within sight of death is not animated by such sentiments tell me tell me rash boy who thou art or the rack shall force thy secret from thee,2
thou hast threatened me with death already said the youth for the truth i have told thee if that is all the encouragement i am to expect for sincerity i am not tempted to indulge thy vain curiosity farther,2
bear him away into the courtyard said manfred i will see his head this instant severed from his body,2
matilda fainted at hearing those words bianca shrieked and criedhelp help the princess is dead,2
manfred started at this ejaculation and demanded what was the matter the young peasant who heard it too was struck with horror and asked eagerly the same question but manfred ordered him to be hurried into the court and kept there for execution till he had informed himself of the cause of biancas shrieks when he learned the meaning he treated it as a womanish panic and ordering matilda to be carried to her apartment he rushed into the court and calling for one of his guards bade theodore kneel down and prepare to receive the fatal blow,2
the undaunted youth received the bitter sentence with a resignation that touched every heart but manfreds he wished earnestly to know the meaning of the words he had heard relating to the princess but fearing to exasperate the tyrant more against her he desisted the only boon he deigned to ask was that he might be permitted to have a confessor and make his peace with heaven manfred who hoped by the confessors means to come at the youths history readily granted his request and being convinced that father jerome was now in his interest he ordered him to be called and shrive the prisoner the holy man who had little foreseen the catastrophe that his imprudence occasioned fell on his knees to the prince and adjured him in the most solemn manner not to shed innocent blood he accused himself in the bitterest terms for his indiscretion endeavoured to disculpate the youth and left no method untried to soften the tyrants rage manfred more incensed than appeased by jeromes intercession whose retraction now made him suspect he had been imposed upon by both commanded the friar to do his duty telling him he would not allow the prisoner many minutes for confession,2
nor do i ask many my lord said the unhappy young man my sins thank heaven have not been numerous nor exceed what might be expected at my years dry your tears good father and let us despatch this is a bad world nor have i had cause to leave it with regret,2
oh wretched youth said jerome how canst thou bear the sight of me with patience i am thy murderer it is i have brought this dismal hour upon thee,2
i forgive thee from my soul said the youth as i hope heaven will pardon me hear my confession father and give me thy blessing,2
how can i prepare thee for thy passage as i ought said jerome thou canst not be saved without pardoning thy foesand canst thou forgive that impious man there,2
and does not this touch thee cruel prince said the friar,2
i sent for thee to confess him said manfred sternly not to plead for him thou didst first incense me against himhis blood be upon thy head,2
it will it will said the good man in an agony of sorrow thou and i must never hope to go where this blessed youth is going,2
despatch said manfred i am no more to be moved by the whining of priests than by the shrieks of women,2
what said the youth is it possible that my fate could have occasioned what i heard is the princess then again in thy power,2
thou dost but remember me of my wrath said manfred prepare thee for this moment is thy last,2
the youth who felt his indignation rise and who was touched with the sorrow which he saw he had infused into all the spectators as well as into the friar suppressed his emotions and putting off his doublet and unbuttoning his collar knelt down to his prayers as he stooped his shirt slipped down below his shoulder and discovered the mark of a bloody arrow,2
gracious heaven cried the holy man starting what do i see it is my child my theodore,2
the passions that ensued must be conceived they cannot be painted the tears of the assistants were suspended by wonder rather than stopped by joy they seemed to inquire in the eyes of their lord what they ought to feel surprise doubt tenderness respect succeeded each other in the countenance of the youth he received with modest submission the effusion of the old mans tears and embraces yet afraid of giving a loose to hope and suspecting from what had passed the inflexibility of manfreds temper he cast a glance towards the prince as if to say canst thou be unmoved at such a scene as this,2
manfreds heart was capable of being touched he forgot his anger in his astonishment yet his pride forbad his owning himself affected he even doubted whether this discovery was not a contrivance of the friar to save the youth,2
what may this mean said he how can he be thy son is it consistent with thy profession or reputed sanctity to avow a peasants offspring for the fruit of thy irregular amours,2
oh god said the holy man dost thou question his being mine could i feel the anguish i do if i were not his father spare him good prince spare him and revile me as thou pleasest,2
spare him spare him cried the attendants for this good mans sake,2
peace said manfred sternly i must know more ere i am disposed to pardon a saints bastard may be no saint himself,2
injurious lord said theodore add not insult to cruelty if i am this venerable mans son though no prince as thou art know the blood that flows in my veins,2
yes said the friar interrupting him his blood is noble nor is he that abject thing my lord you speak him he is my lawful son and sicily can boast of few houses more ancient than that of falconara but alas my lord what is blood what is nobility we are all reptiles miserable sinful creatures it is piety alone that can distinguish us from the dust whence we sprung and whither we must return,2
truce to your sermon said manfred you forget you are no longer friar jerome but the count of falconara let me know your history you will have time to moralise hereafter if you should not happen to obtain the grace of that sturdy criminal there,2
mother of god said the friar is it possible my lord can refuse a father the life of his only his longlost child trample me my lord scorn afflict me accept my life for his but spare my son,2
thou canst feel then said manfred what it is to lose an only son a little hour ago thou didst preach up resignation to me my house if fate so pleased must perishbut the count of falconara,2
alas my lord said jerome i confess i have offended but aggravate not an old mans sufferings i boast not of my family nor think of such vanitiesit is nature that pleads for this boy it is the memory of the dear woman that bore him is she theodore is she dead,2
her soul has long been with the blessed said theodore,2
oh how cried jerome tell menoshe is happy thou art all my care nowmost dread lord will youwill you grant me my poor boys life,2
return to thy convent answered manfred conduct the princess hither obey me in what else thou knowest and i promise thee the life of thy son,2
oh my lord said jerome is my honesty the price i must pay for this dear youths safety,2
for me cried theodore let me die a thousand deaths rather than stain thy conscience what is it the tyrant would exact of thee is the princess still safe from his power protect her thou venerable old man and let all the weight of his wrath fall on me,2
jerome endeavoured to check the impetuosity of the youth and ere manfred could reply the trampling of horses was heard and a brazen trumpet which hung without the gate of the castle was suddenly sounded at the same instant the sable plumes on the enchanted helmet which still remained at the other end of the court were tempestuously agitated and nodded thrice as if bowed by some invisible wearer,2
manfreds heart misgave him when he beheld the plumage on the miraculous casque shaken in concert with the sounding of the brazen trumpet,2
father said he to jerome whom he now ceased to treat as count of falconara what mean these portents if i have offended the plumes were shaken with greater violence than before,2
unhappy prince that i am cried manfred holy father will you not assist me with your prayers,2
my lord replied jerome heaven is no doubt displeased with your mockery of its servants submit yourself to the church and cease to persecute her ministers dismiss this innocent youth and learn to respect the holy character i wear heaven will not be trifled with you see the trumpet sounded again,2
i acknowledge i have been too hasty said manfred father do you go to the wicket and demand who is at the gate,2
do you grant me the life of theodore replied the friar,2
jerome falling on the neck of his son discharged a flood of tears that spoke the fulness of his soul,2
i thought replied the friar your highness would excuse my thanking you first in this tribute of my heart,2
go dearest sir said theodore obey the prince i do not deserve that you should delay his satisfaction for me,2
from the knight of the gigantic sabre said the herald and i must speak with the usurper of otranto,2
jerome returned to the prince and did not fail to repeat the message in the very words it had been uttered the first sounds struck manfred with terror but when he heard himself styled usurper his rage rekindled and all his courage revived,2
usurperinsolent villain cried he who dares to question my title retire father this is no business for monks i will meet this presumptuous man myself go to your convent and prepare the princesss return your son shall be a hostage for your fidelity his life depends on your obedience,2
good heaven my lord cried jerome your highness did but this instant freely pardon my childhave you so soon forgot the interposition of heaven,2
heaven replied manfred does not send heralds to question the title of a lawful prince i doubt whether it even notifies its will through friarsbut that is your affair not mine at present you know my pleasure and it is not a saucy herald that shall save your son if you do not return with the princess,2
it was in vain for the holy man to reply manfred commanded him to be conducted to the posterngate and shut out from the castle and he ordered some of his attendants to carry theodore to the top of the black tower and guard him strictly scarce permitting the father and son to exchange a hasty embrace at parting he then withdrew to the hall and seating himself in princely state ordered the herald to be admitted to his presence,2
well thou insolent said the prince what wouldst thou with me,2
i come replied he to thee manfred usurper of the principality of otranto from the renowned and invincible knight the knight of the gigantic sabre in the name of his lord frederic marquis of vicenza he demands the lady isabella daughter of that prince whom thou hast basely and traitorously got into thy power by bribing her false guardians during his absence and he requires thee to resign the principality of otranto which thou hast usurped from the said lord frederic the nearest of blood to the last rightful lord alfonso the good if thou dost not instantly comply with these just demands he defies thee to single combat to the last extremity and so saying the herald cast down his warder,2
and where is this braggart who sends thee said manfred,2
at the distance of a league said the herald he comes to make good his lords claim against thee as he is a true knight and thou an usurper and ravisher,2
injurious as this challenge was manfred reflected that it was not his interest to provoke the marquis he knew how well founded the claim of frederic was nor was this the first time he had heard of it frederics ancestors had assumed the style of princes of otranto from the death of alfonso the good without issue but manfred his father and grandfather had been too powerful for the house of vicenza to dispossess them frederic a martial and amorous young prince had married a beautiful young lady of whom he was enamoured and who had died in childbed of isabella her death affected him so much that he had taken the cross and gone to the holy land where he was wounded in an engagement against the infidels made prisoner and reported to be dead when the news reached manfreds ears he bribed the guardians of the lady isabella to deliver her up to him as a bride for his son conrad by which alliance he had proposed to unite the claims of the two houses this motive on conrads death had cooperated to make him so suddenly resolve on espousing her himself and the same reflection determined him now to endeavour at obtaining the consent of frederic to this marriage a like policy inspired him with the thought of inviting frederics champion into the castle lest he should be informed of isabellas flight which he strictly enjoined his domestics not to disclose to any of the knights retinue,2
herald said manfred as soon as he had digested these reflections return to thy master and tell him ere we liquidate our differences by the sword manfred would hold some converse with him bid him welcome to my castle where by my faith as i am a true knight he shall have courteous reception and full security for himself and followers if we cannot adjust our quarrel by amicable means i swear he shall depart in safety and shall have full satisfaction according to the laws of arms so help me god and his holy trinity,2
during this interview jeromes mind was agitated by a thousand contrary passions he trembled for the life of his son and his first thought was to persuade isabella to return to the castle yet he was scarce less alarmed at the thought of her union with manfred he dreaded hippolitas unbounded submission to the will of her lord and though he did not doubt but he could alarm her piety not to consent to a divorce if he could get access to her yet should manfred discover that the obstruction came from him it might be equally fatal to theodore he was impatient to know whence came the herald who with so little management had questioned the title of manfred yet he did not dare absent himself from the convent lest isabella should leave it and her flight be imputed to him he returned disconsolately to the monastery uncertain on what conduct to resolve a monk who met him in the porch and observed his melancholy air said,2
alas brother is it then true that we have lost our excellent princess hippolita,2
the holy man started and cried what meanest thou brother i come this instant from the castle and left her in perfect health,2
martelli replied the other friar passed by the convent but a quarter of an hour ago on his way from the castle and reported that her highness was dead all our brethren are gone to the chapel to pray for her happy transit to a better life and willed me to wait thy arrival they know thy holy attachment to that good lady and are anxious for the affliction it will cause in theeindeed we have all reason to weep she was a mother to our house but this life is but a pilgrimage we must not murmurwe shall all follow her may our end be like hers,2
good brother thou dreamest said jerome i tell thee i come from the castle and left the princess well where is the lady isabella,2
poor gentlewoman replied the friar i told her the sad news and offered her spiritual comfort i reminded her of the transitory condition of mortality and advised her to take the veil i quoted the example of the holy princess sanchia of arragon,2
thy zeal was laudable said jerome impatiently but at present it was unnecessary hippolita is wellat least i trust in the lord she is i heard nothing to the contraryyet methinks the princes earnestnesswell brother but where is the lady isabella,2
i know not said the friar she wept much and said she would retire to her chamber,2
jerome left his comrade abruptly and hastened to the princess but she was not in her chamber he inquired of the domestics of the convent but could learn no news of her he searched in vain throughout the monastery and the church and despatched messengers round the neighbourhood to get intelligence if she had been seen but to no purpose nothing could equal the good mans perplexity he judged that isabella suspecting manfred of having precipitated his wifes death had taken the alarm and withdrawn herself to some more secret place of concealment this new flight would probably carry the princes fury to the height the report of hippolitas death though it seemed almost incredible increased his consternation and though isabellas escape bespoke her aversion of manfred for a husband jerome could feel no comfort from it while it endangered the life of his son he determined to return to the castle and made several of his brethren accompany him to attest his innocence to manfred and if necessary join their intercession with his for theodore,2
the prince in the meantime had passed into the court and ordered the gates of the castle to be flung open for the reception of the stranger knight and his train in a few minutes the cavalcade arrived first came two harbingers with wands next a herald followed by two pages and two trumpets then a hundred footguards these were attended by as many horse after them fifty footmen clothed in scarlet and black the colours of the knight then a led horse two heralds on each side of a gentleman on horseback bearing a banner with the arms of vicenza and otranto quarterlya circumstance that much offended manfredbut he stifled his resentment two more pages the knights confessor telling his beads fifty more footmen clad as before two knights habited in complete armour their beavers down comrades to the principal knight the squires of the two knights carrying their shields and devices the knights own squire a hundred gentlemen bearing an enormous sword and seeming to faint under the weight of it the knight himself on a chestnut steed in complete armour his lance in the rest his face entirely concealed by his vizor which was surmounted by a large plume of scarlet and black feathers fifty footguards with drums and trumpets closed the procession which wheeled off to the right and left to make room for the principal knight,2
as soon as he approached the gate he stopped and the herald advancing read again the words of the challenge manfreds eyes were fixed on the gigantic sword and he scarce seemed to attend to the cartel but his attention was soon diverted by a tempest of wind that rose behind him he turned and beheld the plumes of the enchanted helmet agitated in the same extraordinary manner as before it required intrepidity like manfreds not to sink under a concurrence of circumstances that seemed to announce his fate yet scorning in the presence of strangers to betray the courage he had always manifested he said boldly,2
sir knight whoever thou art i bid thee welcome if thou art of mortal mould thy valour shall meet its equal and if thou art a true knight thou wilt scorn to employ sorcery to carry thy point be these omens from heaven or hell manfred trusts to the righteousness of his cause and to the aid of st nicholas who has ever protected his house alight sir knight and repose thyself tomorrow thou shalt have a fair field and heaven befriend the juster side,2
the knight made no reply but dismounting was conducted by manfred to the great hall of the castle as they traversed the court the knight stopped to gaze on the miraculous casque and kneeling down seemed to pray inwardly for some minutes rising he made a sign to the prince to lead on as soon as they entered the hall manfred proposed to the stranger to disarm but the knight shook his head in token of refusal,2
sir knight said manfred this is not courteous but by my good faith i will not cross thee nor shalt thou have cause to complain of the prince of otranto no treachery is designed on my part i hope none is intended on thine here take my gage giving him his ring your friends and you shall enjoy the laws of hospitality rest here until refreshments are brought i will but give orders for the accommodation of your train and return to you the three knights bowed as accepting his courtesy manfred directed the strangers retinue to be conducted to an adjacent hospital founded by the princess hippolita for the reception of pilgrims as they made the circuit of the court to return towards the gate the gigantic sword burst from the supporters and falling to the ground opposite to the helmet remained immovable manfred almost hardened to preternatural appearances surmounted the shock of this new prodigy and returning to the hall where by this time the feast was ready he invited his silent guests to take their places manfred however ill his heart was at ease endeavoured to inspire the company with mirth he put several questions to them but was answered only by signs they raised their vizors but sufficiently to feed themselves and that sparingly,2
sirs said the prince ye are the first guests i ever treated within these walls who scorned to hold any intercourse with me nor has it oft been customary i ween for princes to hazard their state and dignity against strangers and mutes you say you come in the name of frederic of vicenza i have ever heard that he was a gallant and courteous knight nor would he i am bold to say think it beneath him to mix in social converse with a prince that is his equal and not unknown by deeds in arms still ye are silentwell be it as it mayby the laws of hospitality and chivalry ye are masters under this roof ye shall do your pleasure but come give me a goblet of wine ye will not refuse to pledge me to the healths of your fair mistresses,2
the principal knight sighed and crossed himself and was rising from the board,2
sir knight said manfred what i said was but in sport i shall constrain you in nothing use your good liking since mirth is not your mood let us be sad business may hit your fancies better let us withdraw and hear if what i have to unfold may be better relished than the vain efforts i have made for your pastime,2
manfred then conducting the three knights into an inner chamber shut the door and inviting them to be seated began thus addressing himself to the chief personage,2
you come sir knight as i understand in the name of the marquis of vicenza to redemand the lady isabella his daughter who has been contracted in the face of holy church to my son by the consent of her legal guardians and to require me to resign my dominions to your lord who gives himself for the nearest of blood to prince alfonso whose soul god rest i shall speak to the latter article of your demands first you must know your lord knows that i enjoy the principality of otranto from my father don manuel as he received it from his father don ricardo alfonso their predecessor dying childless in the holy land bequeathed his estates to my grandfather don ricardo in consideration of his faithful services the stranger shook his head,2
sir knight said manfred warmly ricardo was a valiant and upright man he was a pious man witness his munificent foundation of the adjoining church and two convents he was peculiarly patronised by st nicholasmy grandfather was incapablei say sir don ricardo was incapableexcuse me your interruption has disordered me i venerate the memory of my grandfather well sirs he held this estate he held it by his good sword and by the favour of st nicholasso did my father and so sirs will i come what come will but frederic your lord is nearest in blood i have consented to put my title to the issue of the sword does that imply a vicious title i might have asked where is frederic your lord report speaks him dead in captivity you say your actions say he livesi question it noti might sirs i mightbut i do not other princes would bid frederic take his inheritance by force if he can they would not stake their dignity on a single combat they would not submit it to the decision of unknown mutespardon me gentlemen i am too warm but suppose yourselves in my situation as ye are stout knights would it not move your choler to have your own and the honour of your ancestors called in question but to the point ye require me to deliver up the lady isabella sirs i must ask if ye are authorised to receive her,2
receive her continued manfred well you are authorised to receive her but gentle knight may i ask if you have full powers,2
tis well said manfred then hear what i have to offer ye see gentlemen before you the most unhappy of men he began to weep afford me your compassion i am entitled to it indeed i am know i have lost my only hope my joy the support of my houseconrad died yester morning,2
yes sirs fate has disposed of my son isabella is at liberty,2
do you then restore her cried the chief knight breaking silence,2
afford me your patience said manfred i rejoice to find by this testimony of your goodwill that this matter may be adjusted without blood it is no interest of mine dictates what little i have farther to say ye behold in me a man disgusted with the world the loss of my son has weaned me from earthly cares power and greatness have no longer any charms in my eyes i wished to transmit the sceptre i had received from my ancestors with honour to my sonbut that is over life itself is so indifferent to me that i accepted your defiance with joy a good knight cannot go to the grave with more satisfaction than when falling in his vocation whatever is the will of heaven i submit for alas sirs i am a man of many sorrows manfred is no object of envy but no doubt you are acquainted with my story,2
the knight made signs of ignorance and seemed curious to have manfred proceed,2
is it possible sirs continued the prince that my story should be a secret to you have you heard nothing relating to me and the princess hippolita,2
no thus then sirs it is you think me ambitious ambition alas is composed of more rugged materials if i were ambitious i should not for so many years have been a prey to all the hell of conscientious scruples but i weary your patience i will be brief know then that i have long been troubled in mind on my union with the princess hippolita oh sirs if ye were acquainted with that excellent woman if ye knew that i adore her like a mistress and cherish her as a friendbut man was not born for perfect happiness she shares my scruples and with her consent i have brought this matter before the church for we are related within the forbidden degrees i expect every hour the definitive sentence that must separate us for everi am sure you feel for mei see you dopardon these tears,2
the knights gazed on each other wondering where this would end,2
the death of my son betiding while my soul was under this anxiety i thought of nothing but resigning my dominions and retiring for ever from the sight of mankind my only difficulty was to fix on a successor who would be tender of my people and to dispose of the lady isabella who is dear to me as my own blood i was willing to restore the line of alfonso even in his most distant kindred and though pardon me i am satisfied it was his will that ricardos lineage should take place of his own relations yet where was i to search for those relations i knew of none but frederic your lord he was a captive to the infidels or dead and were he living and at home would he quit the flourishing state of vicenza for the inconsiderable principality of otranto if he would not could i bear the thought of seeing a hard unfeeling viceroy set over my poor faithful people for sirs i love my people and thank heaven am beloved by them but ye will ask whither tends this long discourse briefly then thus sirs heaven in your arrival seems to point out a remedy for these difficulties and my misfortunes the lady isabella is at liberty i shall soon be so i would submit to anything for the good of my people were it not the best the only way to extinguish the feuds between our families if i was to take the lady isabella to wife you start but though hippolitas virtues will ever be dear to me a prince must not consider himself he is born for his people a servant at that instant entering the chamber apprised manfred that jerome and several of his brethren demanded immediate access to him,2
the prince provoked at this interruption and fearing that the friar would discover to the strangers that isabella had taken sanctuary was going to forbid jeromes entrance but recollecting that he was certainly arrived to notify the princesss return manfred began to excuse himself to the knights for leaving them for a few moments but was prevented by the arrival of the friars manfred angrily reprimanded them for their intrusion and would have forced them back from the chamber but jerome was too much agitated to be repulsed he declared aloud the flight of isabella with protestations of his own innocence,2
manfred distracted at the news and not less at its coming to the knowledge of the strangers uttered nothing but incoherent sentences now upbraiding the friar now apologising to the knights earnest to know what was become of isabella yet equally afraid of their knowing impatient to pursue her yet dreading to have them join in the pursuit he offered to despatch messengers in quest of her but the chief knight no longer keeping silence reproached manfred in bitter terms for his dark and ambiguous dealing and demanded the cause of isabellas first absence from the castle manfred casting a stern look at jerome implying a command of silence pretended that on conrads death he had placed her in sanctuary until he could determine how to dispose of her jerome who trembled for his sons life did not dare contradict this falsehood but one of his brethren not under the same anxiety declared frankly that she had fled to their church in the preceding night the prince in vain endeavoured to stop this discovery which overwhelmed him with shame and confusion the principal stranger amazed at the contradictions he heard and more than half persuaded that manfred had secreted the princess notwithstanding the concern he expressed at her flight rushing to the door said,2
manfred endeavoured to hold him but the other knights assisting their comrade he broke from the prince and hastened into the court demanding his attendants manfred finding it vain to divert him from the pursuit offered to accompany him and summoning his attendants and taking jerome and some of the friars to guide them they issued from the castle manfred privately giving orders to have the knights company secured while to the knight he affected to despatch a messenger to require their assistance,2
the company had no sooner quitted the castle than matilda who felt herself deeply interested for the young peasant since she had seen him condemned to death in the hall and whose thoughts had been taken up with concerting measures to save him was informed by some of the female attendants that manfred had despatched all his men various ways in pursuit of isabella he had in his hurry given this order in general terms not meaning to extend it to the guard he had set upon theodore but forgetting it the domestics officious to obey so peremptory a prince and urged by their own curiosity and love of novelty to join in any precipitate chase had to a man left the castle matilda disengaged herself from her women stole up to the black tower and unbolting the door presented herself to the astonished theodore,2
young man said she though filial duty and womanly modesty condemn the step i am taking yet holy charity surmounting all other ties justifies this act fly the doors of thy prison are open my father and his domestics are absent but they may soon return be gone in safety and may the angels of heaven direct thy course,2
thou art surely one of those angels said the enraptured theodore none but a blessed saint could speak could actcould looklike thee may i not know the name of my divine protectress methought thou namedst thy father is it possible can manfreds blood feel holy pity lovely lady thou answerest not but how art thou here thyself why dost thou neglect thy own safety and waste a thought on a wretch like theodore let us fly together the life thou bestowest shall be dedicated to thy defence,2
alas thou mistakest said matilda sighing i am manfreds daughter but no dangers await me,2
amazement said theodore but last night i blessed myself for yielding thee the service thy gracious compassion so charitably returns me now,2
still thou art in an error said the princess but this is no time for explanation fly virtuous youth while it is in my power to save thee should my father return thou and i both should indeed have cause to tremble,2
how said theodore thinkest thou charming maid that i will accept of life at the hazard of aught calamitous to thee better i endured a thousand deaths,2
i run no risk said matilda but by thy delay depart it cannot be known that i have assisted thy flight,2
swear by the saints above said theodore that thou canst not be suspected else here i vow to await whatever can befall me,2
oh thou art too generous said matilda but rest assured that no suspicion can alight on me,2
give me thy beauteous hand in token that thou dost not deceive me said theodore and let me bathe it with the warm tears of gratitude,2
alas said theodore i have never known but calamity until this hourperhaps shall never know other fortune again suffer the chaste raptures of holy gratitude tis my soul would print its effusions on thy hand,2
forbear and be gone said matilda how would isabella approve of seeing thee at my feet,2
ah me i fear said the princess i am serving a deceitful one hast thou forgot thy curiosity this morning,2
thy looks thy actions all thy beauteous self seem an emanation of divinity said theodore but thy words are dark and mysterious speak lady speak to thy servants comprehension,2
thou understandest but too well said matilda but once more i command thee to be gone thy blood which i may preserve will be on my head if i waste the time in vain discourse,2
i go lady said theodore because it is thy will and because i would not bring the grey hairs of my father with sorrow to the grave say but adored lady that i have thy gentle pity,2
stay said matilda i will conduct thee to the subterraneous vault by which isabella escaped it will lead thee to the church of st nicholas where thou mayst take sanctuary,2
what said theodore was it another and not thy lovely self that i assisted to find the subterraneous passage,2
it was said matilda but ask no more i tremble to see thee still abide here fly to the sanctuary,2
to sanctuary said theodore no princess sanctuaries are for helpless damsels or for criminals theodores soul is free from guilt nor will wear the appearance of it give me a sword lady and thy father shall learn that theodore scorns an ignominious flight,2
rash youth said matilda thou wouldst not dare to lift thy presumptuous arm against the prince of otranto,2
not against thy father indeed i dare not said theodore excuse me lady i had forgotten but could i gaze on thee and remember thou art sprung from the tyrant manfred but he is thy father and from this moment my injuries are buried in oblivion,2
a deep and hollow groan which seemed to come from above startled the princess and theodore,2
good heaven we are overheard said the princess they listened but perceiving no further noise they both concluded it the effect of pentup vapours and the princess preceding theodore softly carried him to her fathers armoury where equipping him with a complete suit he was conducted by matilda to the posterngate,2
avoid the town said the princess and all the western side of the castle tis there the search must be making by manfred and the strangers but hie thee to the opposite quarter yonder behind that forest to the east is a chain of rocks hollowed into a labyrinth of caverns that reach to the sea coast there thou mayst lie concealed till thou canst make signs to some vessel to put on shore and take thee off go heaven be thy guideand sometimes in thy prayers remembermatilda,2
theodore flung himself at her feet and seizing her lily hand which with struggles she suffered him to kiss he vowed on the earliest opportunity to get himself knighted and fervently entreated her permission to swear himself eternally her knight ere the princess could reply a clap of thunder was suddenly heard that shook the battlements theodore regardless of the tempest would have urged his suit but the princess dismayed retreated hastily into the castle and commanded the youth to be gone with an air that would not be disobeyed he sighed and retired but with eyes fixed on the gate until matilda closing it put an end to an interview in which the hearts of both had drunk so deeply of a passion which both now tasted for the first time,2
theodore went pensively to the convent to acquaint his father with his deliverance there he learned the absence of jerome and the pursuit that was making after the lady isabella with some particulars of whose story he now first became acquainted the generous gallantry of his nature prompted him to wish to assist her but the monks could lend him no lights to guess at the route she had taken he was not tempted to wander far in search of her for the idea of matilda had imprinted itself so strongly on his heart that he could not bear to absent himself at much distance from her abode the tenderness jerome had expressed for him concurred to confirm this reluctance and he even persuaded himself that filial affection was the chief cause of his hovering between the castle and monastery,2
until jerome should return at night theodore at length determined to repair to the forest that matilda had pointed out to him arriving there he sought the gloomiest shades as best suited to the pleasing melancholy that reigned in his mind in this mood he roved insensibly to the caves which had formerly served as a retreat to hermits and were now reported round the country to be haunted by evil spirits he recollected to have heard this tradition and being of a brave and adventurous disposition he willingly indulged his curiosity in exploring the secret recesses of this labyrinth he had not penetrated far before he thought he heard the steps of some person who seemed to retreat before him,2
theodore though firmly grounded in all our holy faith enjoins to be believed had no apprehension that good men were abandoned without cause to the malice of the powers of darkness he thought the place more likely to be infested by robbers than by those infernal agents who are reported to molest and bewilder travellers he had long burned with impatience to approve his valour drawing his sabre he marched sedately onwards still directing his steps as the imperfect rustling sound before him led the way the armour he wore was a like indication to the person who avoided him theodore now convinced that he was not mistaken redoubled his pace and evidently gained on the person that fled whose haste increasing theodore came up just as a woman fell breathless before him he hasted to raise her but her terror was so great that he apprehended she would faint in his arms he used every gentle word to dispel her alarms and assured her that far from injuring he would defend her at the peril of his life the lady recovering her spirits from his courteous demeanour and gazing on her protector said,2
not to my knowledge replied theodore unless as i conjecture thou art the lady isabella,2
merciful heaven cried she thou art not sent in quest of me art thou and saying those words she threw herself at his feet and besought him not to deliver her up to manfred,2
to manfred cried theodoreno lady i have once already delivered thee from his tyranny and it shall fare hard with me now but i will place thee out of the reach of his daring,2
is it possible said she that thou shouldst be the generous unknown whom i met last night in the vault of the castle sure thou art not a mortal but my guardian angel on my knees let me thank,2
hold gentle princess said theodore nor demean thyself before a poor and friendless young man if heaven has selected me for thy deliverer it will accomplish its work and strengthen my arm in thy cause but come lady we are too near the mouth of the cavern let us seek its inmost recesses i can have no tranquillity till i have placed thee beyond the reach of danger,2
alas what mean you sir said she though all your actions are noble though your sentiments speak the purity of your soul is it fitting that i should accompany you alone into these perplexed retreats should we be found together what would a censorious world think of my conduct,2
i respect your virtuous delicacy said theodore nor do you harbour a suspicion that wounds my honour i meant to conduct you into the most private cavity of these rocks and then at the hazard of my life to guard their entrance against every living thing besides lady continued he drawing a deep sigh beauteous and all perfect as your form is and though my wishes are not guiltless of aspiring know my soul is dedicated to another and although a sudden noise prevented theodore from proceeding they soon distinguished these sounds,2
isabella what ho isabella the trembling princess relapsed into her former agony of fear theodore endeavoured to encourage her but in vain he assured her he would die rather than suffer her to return under manfreds power and begging her to remain concealed he went forth to prevent the person in search of her from approaching,2
at the mouth of the cavern he found an armed knight discoursing with a peasant who assured him he had seen a lady enter the passes of the rock the knight was preparing to seek her when theodore placing himself in his way with his sword drawn sternly forbad him at his peril to advance,2
and who art thou who darest to cross my way said the knight haughtily,2
one who does not dare more than he will perform said theodore,2
i seek the lady isabella said the knight and understand she has taken refuge among these rocks impede me not or thou wilt repent having provoked my resentment,2
thy purpose is as odious as thy resentment is contemptible said theodore return whence thou camest or we shall soon know whose resentment is most terrible,2
the stranger who was the principal knight that had arrived from the marquis of vicenza had galloped from manfred as he was busied in getting information of the princess and giving various orders to prevent her falling into the power of the three knights their chief had suspected manfred of being privy to the princesss absconding and this insult from a man who he concluded was stationed by that prince to secrete her confirming his suspicions he made no reply but discharging a blow with his sabre at theodore would soon have removed all obstruction if theodore who took him for one of manfreds captains and who had no sooner given the provocation than prepared to support it had not received the stroke on his shield the valour that had so long been smothered in his breast broke forth at once he rushed impetuously on the knight whose pride and wrath were not less powerful incentives to hardy deeds the combat was furious but not long theodore wounded the knight in three several places and at last disarmed him as he fainted by the loss of blood,2
the peasant who had fled on the first onset had given the alarm to some of manfreds domestics who by his orders were dispersed through the forest in pursuit of isabella they came up as the knight fell whom they soon discovered to be the noble stranger theodore notwithstanding his hatred to manfred could not behold the victory he had gained without emotions of pity and generosity but he was more touched when he learned the quality of his adversary and was informed that he was no retainer but an enemy of manfred he assisted the servants of the latter in disarming the knight and in endeavouring to stanch the blood that flowed from his wounds the knight recovering his speech said in a faint and faltering voice,2
generous foe we have both been in an error i took thee for an instrument of the tyrant i perceive thou hast made the like mistake it is too late for excuses i faint if isabella is at handcall heri have important secrets to,2
he is dying said one of the attendants has nobody a crucifix about them andrea do thou pray over him,2
fetch some water said theodore and pour it down his throat while i hasten to the princess,2
saying this he flew to isabella and in few words told her modestly that he had been so unfortunate by mistake as to wound a gentleman from her fathers court who wished ere he died to impart something of consequence to her,2
the princess who had been transported at hearing the voice of theodore as he called to her to come forth was astonished at what she heard suffering herself to be conducted by theodore the new proof of whose valour recalled her dispersed spirits she came where the bleeding knight lay speechless on the ground but her fears returned when she beheld the domestics of manfred she would again have fled if theodore had not made her observe that they were unarmed and had not threatened them with instant death if they should dare to seize the princess,2
the stranger opening his eyes and beholding a woman said art thoupray tell me trulyart thou isabella of vicenza,2
then thouthen thousaid the knight struggling for utteranceseestthy father give me one,2
oh amazement horror what do i hear what do i see cried isabella my father you my father how came you here sir for heavens sake speak oh run for help or he will expire,2
tis most true said the wounded knight exerting all his force i am frederic thy father yes i came to deliver thee it will not be give me a parting kiss and take,2
sir said theodore do not exhaust yourself suffer us to convey you to the castle,2
to the castle said isabella is there no help nearer than the castle would you expose my father to the tyrant if he goes thither i dare not accompany him and yet can i leave him,2
my child said frederic it matters not for me whither i am carried a few minutes will place me beyond danger but while i have eyes to dote on thee forsake me not dear isabella this brave knighti know not who he iswill protect thy innocence sir you will not abandon my child will you,2
theodore shedding tears over his victim and vowing to guard the princess at the expense of his life persuaded frederic to suffer himself to be conducted to the castle they placed him on a horse belonging to one of the domestics after binding up his wounds as well as they were able theodore marched by his side and the afflicted isabella who could not bear to quit him followed mournfully behind,2
the sorrowful troop no sooner arrived at the castle than they were met by hippolita and matilda whom isabella had sent one of the domestics before to advertise of their approach the ladies causing frederic to be conveyed into the nearest chamber retired while the surgeons examined his wounds matilda blushed at seeing theodore and isabella together but endeavoured to conceal it by embracing the latter and condoling with her on her fathers mischance the surgeons soon came to acquaint hippolita that none of the marquiss wounds were dangerous and that he was desirous of seeing his daughter and the princesses,2
theodore under pretence of expressing his joy at being freed from his apprehensions of the combat being fatal to frederic could not resist the impulse of following matilda her eyes were so often cast down on meeting his that isabella who regarded theodore as attentively as he gazed on matilda soon divined who the object was that he had told her in the cave engaged his affections while this mute scene passed hippolita demanded of frederic the cause of his having taken that mysterious course for reclaiming his daughter and threw in various apologies to excuse her lord for the match contracted between their children,2
frederic however incensed against manfred was not insensible to the courtesy and benevolence of hippolita but he was still more struck with the lovely form of matilda wishing to detain them by his bedside he informed hippolita of his story he told her that while prisoner to the infidels he had dreamed that his daughter of whom he had learned no news since his captivity was detained in a castle where she was in danger of the most dreadful misfortunes and that if he obtained his liberty and repaired to a wood near joppa he would learn more alarmed at this dream and incapable of obeying the direction given by it his chains became more grievous than ever but while his thoughts were occupied on the means of obtaining his liberty he received the agreeable news that the confederate princes who were warring in palestine had paid his ransom he instantly set out for the wood that had been marked in his dream,2
for three days he and his attendants had wandered in the forest without seeing a human form but on the evening of the third they came to a cell in which they found a venerable hermit in the agonies of death applying rich cordials they brought the fainting man to his speech,2
my sons said he i am bounden to your charitybut it is in vaini am going to my eternal restyet i die with the satisfaction of performing the will of heaven when first i repaired to this solitude after seeing my country become a prey to unbelieversit is alas above fifty years since i was witness to that dreadful scene st nicholas appeared to me and revealed a secret which he bade me never disclose to mortal man but on my deathbed this is that tremendous hour and ye are no doubt the chosen warriors to whom i was ordered to reveal my trust as soon as ye have done the last offices to this wretched corse dig under the seventh tree on the left hand of this poor cave and your pains willoh good heaven receive my soul with those words the devout man breathed his last,2
by break of day continued frederic when we had committed the holy relics to earth we dug according to direction but what was our astonishment when about the depth of six feet we discovered an enormous sabrethe very weapon yonder in the court on the blade which was then partly out of the scabbard though since closed by our efforts in removing it were written the following linesno excuse me madam added the marquis turning to hippolita if i forbear to repeat them i respect your sex and rank and would not be guilty of offending your ear with sounds injurious to aught that is dear to you,2
he paused hippolita trembled she did not doubt but frederic was destined by heaven to accomplish the fate that seemed to threaten her house looking with anxious fondness at matilda a silent tear stole down her cheek but recollecting herself she said,2
proceed my lord heaven does nothing in vain mortals must receive its divine behests with lowliness and submission it is our part to deprecate its wrath or bow to its decrees repeat the sentence my lord we listen resigned,2
frederic was grieved that he had proceeded so far the dignity and patient firmness of hippolita penetrated him with respect and the tender silent affection with which the princess and her daughter regarded each other melted him almost to tears yet apprehensive that his forbearance to obey would be more alarming he repeated in a faltering and low voice the following lines,2
whereer a casque that suits this sword is found with perils is thy daughter compassd round alfonsos blood alone can save the maid and quiet a long restless princes shade,2
what is there in these lines said theodore impatiently that affects these princesses why were they to be shocked by a mysterious delicacy that has so little foundation,2
your words are rude young man said the marquis and though fortune has favoured you once,2
my honoured lord said isabella who resented theodores warmth which she perceived was dictated by his sentiments for matilda discompose not yourself for the glosing of a peasants son he forgets the reverence he owes you but he is not accustomed,2
hippolita concerned at the heat that had arisen checked theodore for his boldness but with an air acknowledging his zeal and changing the conversation demanded of frederic where he had left her lord as the marquis was going to reply they heard a noise without and rising to inquire the cause manfred jerome and part of the troop who had met an imperfect rumour of what had happened entered the chamber manfred advanced hastily towards frederics bed to condole with him on his misfortune and to learn the circumstances of the combat when starting in an agony of terror and amazement he cried,2
ha what art thou thou dreadful spectre is my hour come,2
my dearest gracious lord cried hippolita clasping him in her arms what is it you see why do you fix your eyeballs thus,2
what cried manfred breathless dost thou see nothing hippolita is this ghastly phantom sent to me aloneto me who did not,2
for mercys sweetest self my lord said hippolita resume your soul command your reason there is none here but us your friends,2
what is not that alfonso cried manfred dost thou not see him can it be my brains delirium,2
this my lord said hippolita this is theodore the youth who has been so unfortunate,2
theodore said manfred mournfully and striking his forehead theodore or a phantom he has unhinged the soul of manfred but how comes he here and how comes he in armour,2
i believe he went in search of isabella said hippolita,2
of isabella said manfred relapsing into rage yes yes that is not doubtful but how did he escape from durance in which i left him was it isabella or this hypocritical old friar that procured his enlargement,2
and would a parent be criminal my lord said theodore if he meditated the deliverance of his child,2
jerome amazed to hear himself in a manner accused by his son and without foundation knew not what to think he could not comprehend how theodore had escaped how he came to be armed and to encounter frederic still he would not venture to ask any questions that might tend to inflame manfreds wrath against his son jeromes silence convinced manfred that he had contrived theodores release,2
and is it thus thou ungrateful old man said the prince addressing himself to the friar that thou repayest mine and hippolitas bounties and not content with traversing my hearts nearest wishes thou armest thy bastard and bringest him into my own castle to insult me,2
my lord said theodore you wrong my father neither he nor i are capable of harbouring a thought against your peace is it insolence thus to surrender myself to your highnesss pleasure added he laying his sword respectfully at manfreds feet behold my bosom strike my lord if you suspect that a disloyal thought is lodged there there is not a sentiment engraven on my heart that does not venerate you and yours,2
the grace and fervour with which theodore uttered these words interested every person present in his favour even manfred was touchedyet still possessed with his resemblance to alfonso his admiration was dashed with secret horror,2
rise said he thy life is not my present purpose but tell me thy history and how thou camest connected with this old traitor here,2
peace impostor said manfred i will not have him prompted,2
my lord said theodore i want no assistance my story is very brief i was carried at five years of age to algiers with my mother who had been taken by corsairs from the coast of sicily she died of grief in less than a twelvemonth the tears gushed from jeromes eyes on whose countenance a thousand anxious passions stood expressed before she died continued theodore she bound a writing about my arm under my garments which told me i was the son of the count falconara,2
it is most true said jerome i am that wretched father,2
i remained in slavery said theodore until within these two years when attending on my master in his cruises i was delivered by a christian vessel which overpowered the pirate and discovering myself to the captain he generously put me on shore in sicily but alas instead of finding a father i learned that his estate which was situated on the coast had during his absence been laid waste by the rover who had carried my mother and me into captivity that his castle had been burnt to the ground and that my father on his return had sold what remained and was retired into religion in the kingdom of naples but where no man could inform me destitute and friendless hopeless almost of attaining the transport of a parents embrace i took the first opportunity of setting sail for naples from whence within these six days i wandered into this province still supporting myself by the labour of my hands nor until yestermorn did i believe that heaven had reserved any lot for me but peace of mind and contented poverty this my lord is theodores story i am blessed beyond my hope in finding a father i am unfortunate beyond my desert in having incurred your highnesss displeasure,2
he ceased a murmur of approbation gently arose from the audience,2
this is not all said frederic i am bound in honour to add what he suppresses though he is modest i must be generous he is one of the bravest youths on christian ground he is warm too and from the short knowledge i have of him i will pledge myself for his veracity if what he reports of himself were not true he would not utter itand for me youth i honour a frankness which becomes thy birth but now and thou didst offend me yet the noble blood which flows in thy veins may well be allowed to boil out when it has so recently traced itself to its source come my lord turning to manfred if i can pardon him surely you may it is not the youths fault if you took him for a spectre,2
if beings from another world replied he haughtily have power to impress my mind with awe it is more than living man can do nor could a striplings arm,2
my lord interrupted hippolita your guest has occasion for repose shall we not leave him to his rest saying this and taking manfred by the hand she took leave of frederic and led the company forth,2
the prince not sorry to quit a conversation which recalled to mind the discovery he had made of his most secret sensations suffered himself to be conducted to his own apartment after permitting theodore though under engagement to return to the castle on the morrow a condition the young man gladly accepted to retire with his father to the convent matilda and isabella were too much occupied with their own reflections and too little content with each other to wish for farther converse that night they separated each to her chamber with more expressions of ceremony and fewer of affection than had passed between them since their childhood,2
if they parted with small cordiality they did but meet with greater impatience as soon as the sun was risen their minds were in a situation that excluded sleep and each recollected a thousand questions which she wished she had put to the other overnight matilda reflected that isabella had been twice delivered by theodore in very critical situations which she could not believe accidental his eyes it was true had been fixed on her in frederics chamber but that might have been to disguise his passion for isabella from the fathers of both it were better to clear this up she wished to know the truth lest she should wrong her friend by entertaining a passion for isabellas lover thus jealousy prompted and at the same time borrowed an excuse from friendship to justify its curiosity,2
isabella not less restless had better foundation for her suspicions both theodores tongue and eyes had told her his heart was engaged it was trueyet perhaps matilda might not correspond to his passion she had ever appeared insensible to love all her thoughts were set on heaven,2
why did i dissuade her said isabella to herself i am punished for my generosity but when did they meet where it cannot be i have deceived myself perhaps last night was the first time they ever beheld each other it must be some other object that has prepossessed his affectionsif it is i am not so unhappy as i thought if it is not my friend matildahow can i stoop to wish for the affection of a man who rudely and unnecessarily acquainted me with his indifference and that at the very moment in which common courtesy demanded at least expressions of civility i will go to my dear matilda who will confirm me in this becoming pride man is falsei will advise with her on taking the veil she will rejoice to find me in this disposition and i will acquaint her that i no longer oppose her inclination for the cloister,2
in this frame of mind and determined to open her heart entirely to matilda she went to that princesss chamber whom she found already dressed and leaning pensively on her arm this attitude so correspondent to what she felt herself revived isabellas suspicions and destroyed the confidence she had purposed to place in her friend they blushed at meeting and were too much novices to disguise their sensations with address after some unmeaning questions and replies matilda demanded of isabella the cause of her flight the latter who had almost forgotten manfreds passion so entirely was she occupied by her own concluding that matilda referred to her last escape from the convent which had occasioned the events of the preceding evening replied,2
martelli brought word to the convent that your mother was dead,2
oh said matilda interrupting her bianca has explained that mistake to me on seeing me faint she cried out the princess is dead and martelli who had come for the usual dole to the castle,2
and what made you faint said isabella indifferent to the rest matilda blushed and stammered,2
a young man said matilda i believei think it was that young man that,2
yes answered she i never saw him before i do not know how he had offended my father but as he has been of service to you i am glad my lord has pardoned him,2
served me replied isabella do you term it serving me to wound my father and almost occasion his death though it is but since yesterday that i am blessed with knowing a parent i hope matilda does not think i am such a stranger to filial tenderness as not to resent the boldness of that audacious youth and that it is impossible for me ever to feel any affection for one who dared to lift his arm against the author of my being no matilda my heart abhors him and if you still retain the friendship for me that you have vowed from your infancy you will detest a man who has been on the point of making me miserable for ever,2
matilda held down her head and replied i hope my dearest isabella does not doubt her matildas friendship i never beheld that youth until yesterday he is almost a stranger to me but as the surgeons have pronounced your father out of danger you ought not to harbour uncharitable resentment against one who i am persuaded did not know the marquis was related to you,2
you plead his cause very pathetically said isabella considering he is so much a stranger to you i am mistaken or he returns your charity,2
nothing said isabella repenting that she had given matilda a hint of theodores inclination for her then changing the discourse she asked matilda what occasioned manfred to take theodore for a spectre,2
bless me said matilda did not you observe his extreme resemblance to the portrait of alfonso in the gallery i took notice of it to bianca even before i saw him in armour but with the helmet on he is the very image of that picture,2
i do not much observe pictures said isabella much less have i examined this young man so attentively as you seem to have done ah matilda your heart is in danger but let me warn you as a friend he has owned to me that he is in love it cannot be with you for yesterday was the first time you ever metwas it not,2
certainly replied matilda but why does my dearest isabella conclude from anything i have said thatshe pausedthen continuing he saw you first and i am far from having the vanity to think that my little portion of charms could engage a heart devoted to you may you be happy isabella whatever is the fate of matilda,2
my lovely friend said isabella whose heart was too honest to resist a kind expression it is you that theodore admires i saw it i am persuaded of it nor shall a thought of my own happiness suffer me to interfere with yours,2
this frankness drew tears from the gentle matilda and jealousy that for a moment had raised a coolness between these amiable maidens soon gave way to the natural sincerity and candour of their souls each confessed to the other the impression that theodore had made on her and this confidence was followed by a struggle of generosity each insisting on yielding her claim to her friend at length the dignity of isabellas virtue reminding her of the preference which theodore had almost declared for her rival made her determine to conquer her passion and cede the beloved object to her friend,2
during this contest of amity hippolita entered her daughters chamber,2
madam said she to isabella you have so much tenderness for matilda and interest yourself so kindly in whatever affects our wretched house that i can have no secrets with my child which are not proper for you to hear,2
know then madam continued hippolita and you my dearest matilda that being convinced by all the events of these two last ominous days that heaven purposes the sceptre of otranto should pass from manfreds hands into those of the marquis frederic i have been perhaps inspired with the thought of averting our total destruction by the union of our rival houses with this view i have been proposing to manfred my lord to tender this dear dear child to frederic your father,2
me to lord frederic cried matilda good heavens my gracious motherand have you named it to my father,2
i have said hippolita he listened benignly to my proposal and is gone to break it to the marquis,2
ah wretched princess cried isabella what hast thou done what ruin has thy inadvertent goodness been preparing for thyself for me and for matilda,2
ruin from me to you and to my child said hippolita what can this mean,2
alas said isabella the purity of your own heart prevents your seeing the depravity of others manfred your lord that impious man,2
hold said hippolita you must not in my presence young lady mention manfred with disrespect he is my lord and husband and,2
will not long be so said isabella if his wicked purposes can be carried into execution,2
this language amazes me said hippolita your feeling isabella is warm but until this hour i never knew it betray you into intemperance what deed of manfred authorises you to treat him as a murderer an assassin,2
thou virtuous and too credulous princess replied isabella it is not thy life he aims atit is to separate himself from thee to divorce thee to,2
to divorce me to divorce my mother cried hippolita and matilda at once,2
yes said isabella and to complete his crime he meditatesi cannot speak it,2
what can surpass what thou hast already uttered said matilda,2
hippolita was silent grief choked her speech and the recollection of manfreds late ambiguous discourses confirmed what she heard,2
excellent dear lady madam mother cried isabella flinging herself at hippolitas feet in a transport of passion trust me believe me i will die a thousand deaths sooner than consent to injure you than yield to so odiousoh,2
this is too much cried hippolita what crimes does one crime suggest rise dear isabella i do not doubt your virtue oh matilda this stroke is too heavy for thee weep not my child and not a murmur i charge thee remember he is thy father still,2
but you are my mother too said matilda fervently and you are virtuous you are guiltlessoh must not i must not i complain,2
you must not said hippolitacome all will yet be well manfred in the agony for the loss of thy brother knew not what he said perhaps isabella misunderstood him his heart is goodand my child thou knowest not all there is a destiny hangs over us the hand of providence is stretched out oh could i but save thee from the wreck yes continued she in a firmer tone perhaps the sacrifice of myself may atone for all i will go and offer myself to this divorceit boots not what becomes of me i will withdraw into the neighbouring monastery and waste the remainder of life in prayers and tears for my child andthe prince,2
thou art as much too good for this world said isabella as manfred is execrable but think not lady that thy weakness shall determine for me i swear hear me all ye angels,2
stop i adjure thee cried hippolita remember thou dost not depend on thyself thou hast a father,2
my father is too pious too noble interrupted isabella to command an impious deed but should he command it can a father enjoin a cursed act i was contracted to the son can i wed the father no madam no force should not drag me to manfreds hated bed i loathe him i abhor him divine and human laws forbidand my friend my dearest matilda would i wound her tender soul by injuring her adored mother my own motheri never have known another,2
oh she is the mother of both cried matilda can we can we isabella adore her too much,2
my lovely children said the touched hippolita your tenderness overpowers mebut i must not give way to it it is not ours to make election for ourselves heaven our fathers and our husbands must decide for us have patience until you hear what manfred and frederic have determined if the marquis accepts matildas hand i know she will readily obey heaven may interpose and prevent the rest what means my child continued she seeing matilda fall at her feet with a flood of speechless tearsbut no answer me not my daughter i must not hear a word against the pleasure of thy father,2
oh doubt not my obedience my dreadful obedience to him and to you said matilda but can i most respected of women can i experience all this tenderness this world of goodness and conceal a thought from the best of mothers,2
what art thou going to utter said isabella trembling recollect thyself matilda,2
no isabella said the princess i should not deserve this incomparable parent if the inmost recesses of my soul harboured a thought without her permissionnay i have offended her i have suffered a passion to enter my heart without her avowalbut here i disclaim it here i vow to heaven and her,2
my child my child said hippolita what words are these what new calamities has fate in store for us thou a passion thou in this hour of destruction,2
oh i see all my guilt said matilda i abhor myself if i cost my mother a pang she is the dearest thing i have on earthoh i will never never behold him more,2
isabella said hippolita thou art conscious to this unhappy secret whatever it is speak,2
what cried matilda have i so forfeited my mothers love that she will not permit me even to speak my own guilt oh wretched wretched matilda,2
thou art too cruel said isabella to hippolita canst thou behold this anguish of a virtuous mind and not commiserate it,2
not pity my child said hippolita catching matilda in her armsoh i know she is good she is all virtue all tenderness and duty i do forgive thee my excellent my only hope,2
the princesses then revealed to hippolita their mutual inclination for theodore and the purpose of isabella to resign him to matilda hippolita blamed their imprudence and showed them the improbability that either father would consent to bestow his heiress on so poor a man though nobly born some comfort it gave her to find their passion of so recent a date and that theodore had had but little cause to suspect it in either she strictly enjoined them to avoid all correspondence with him this matilda fervently promised but isabella who flattered herself that she meant no more than to promote his union with her friend could not determine to avoid him and made no reply,2
i will go to the convent said hippolita and order new masses to be said for a deliverance from these calamities,2
oh my mother said matilda you mean to quit us you mean to take sanctuary and to give my father an opportunity of pursuing his fatal intention alas on my knees i supplicate you to forbear will you leave me a prey to frederic i will follow you to the convent,2
be at peace my child said hippolita i will return instantly i will never abandon thee until i know it is the will of heaven and for thy benefit,2
do not deceive me said matilda i will not marry frederic until thou commandest it alas what will become of me,2
why that exclamation said hippolita i have promised thee to return,2
ah my mother replied matilda stay and save me from myself a frown from thee can do more than all my fathers severity i have given away my heart and you alone can make me recall it,2
i can quit theodore said she but must i wed another let me attend thee to the altar and shut myself from the world for ever,2
thy fate depends on thy father said hippolita i have illbestowed my tenderness if it has taught thee to revere aught beyond him adieu my child i go to pray for thee,2
hippolitas real purpose was to demand of jerome whether in conscience she might not consent to the divorce she had oft urged manfred to resign the principality which the delicacy of her conscience rendered an hourly burthen to her these scruples concurred to make the separation from her husband appear less dreadful to her than it would have seemed in any other situation,2
jerome at quitting the castle overnight had questioned theodore severely why he had accused him to manfred of being privy to his escape theodore owned it had been with design to prevent manfreds suspicion from alighting on matilda and added the holiness of jeromes life and character secured him from the tyrants wrath jerome was heartily grieved to discover his sons inclination for that princess and leaving him to his rest promised in the morning to acquaint him with important reasons for conquering his passion,2
theodore like isabella was too recently acquainted with parental authority to submit to its decisions against the impulse of his heart he had little curiosity to learn the friars reasons and less disposition to obey them the lovely matilda had made stronger impressions on him than filial affection all night he pleased himself with visions of love and it was not till late after the morningoffice that he recollected the friars commands to attend him at alfonsos tomb,2
young man said jerome when he saw him this tardiness does not please me have a fathers commands already so little weight,2
theodore made awkward excuses and attributed his delay to having overslept himself,2
and on whom were thy dreams employed said the friar sternly his son blushed come come resumed the friar inconsiderate youth this must not be eradicate this guilty passion from thy breast,2
guilty passion cried theodore can guilt dwell with innocent beauty and virtuous modesty,2
it is sinful replied the friar to cherish those whom heaven has doomed to destruction a tyrants race must be swept from the earth to the third and fourth generation,2
will heaven visit the innocent for the crimes of the guilty said theodore the fair matilda has virtues enough,2
to undo thee interrupted jerome hast thou so soon forgotten that twice the savage manfred has pronounced thy sentence,2
nor have i forgotten sir said theodore that the charity of his daughter delivered me from his power i can forget injuries but never benefits,2
the injuries thou hast received from manfreds race said the friar are beyond what thou canst conceive reply not but view this holy image beneath this marble monument rest the ashes of the good alfonso a prince adorned with every virtue the father of his people the delight of mankind kneel headstrong boy and list while a father unfolds a tale of horror that will expel every sentiment from thy soul but sensations of sacred vengeancealfonso much injured prince let thy unsatisfied shade sit awful on the troubled air while these trembling lipsha who comes there,2
the most wretched of women said hippolita entering the choir good father art thou at leisurebut why this kneeling youth what means the horror imprinted on each countenance why at this venerable tombalas hast thou seen aught,2
we were pouring forth our orisons to heaven replied the friar with some confusion to put an end to the woes of this deplorable province join with us lady thy spotless soul may obtain an exemption from the judgments which the portents of these days but too speakingly denounce against thy house,2
i pray fervently to heaven to divert them said the pious princess thou knowest it has been the occupation of my life to wrest a blessing for my lord and my harmless childrenone alas is taken from me would heaven but hear me for my poor matilda father intercede for her,2
be dumb rash youth said jerome and thou fond princess contend not with the powers above the lord giveth and the lord taketh away bless his holy name and submit to his decrees,2
i do most devoutly said hippolita but will he not spare my only comfort must matilda perish tooah father i camebut dismiss thy son no ear but thine must hear what i have to utter,2
may heaven grant thy every wish most excellent princess said theodore retiring jerome frowned,2
hippolita then acquainted the friar with the proposal she had suggested to manfred his approbation of it and the tender of matilda that he was gone to make to frederic jerome could not conceal his dislike of the notion which he covered under pretence of the improbability that frederic the nearest of blood to alfonso and who was come to claim his succession would yield to an alliance with the usurper of his right but nothing could equal the perplexity of the friar when hippolita confessed her readiness not to oppose the separation and demanded his opinion on the legality of her acquiescence the friar caught eagerly at her request of his advice and without explaining his aversion to the proposed marriage of manfred and isabella he painted to hippolita in the most alarming colours the sinfulness of her consent denounced judgments against her if she complied and enjoined her in the severest terms to treat any such proposition with every mark of indignation and refusal,2
manfred in the meantime had broken his purpose to frederic and proposed the double marriage that weak prince who had been struck with the charms of matilda listened but too eagerly to the offer he forgot his enmity to manfred whom he saw but little hope of dispossessing by force and flattering himself that no issue might succeed from the union of his daughter with the tyrant he looked upon his own succession to the principality as facilitated by wedding matilda he made faint opposition to the proposal affecting for form only not to acquiesce unless hippolita should consent to the divorce manfred took that upon himself,2
transported with his success and impatient to see himself in a situation to expect sons he hastened to his wifes apartment determined to extort her compliance he learned with indignation that she was absent at the convent his guilt suggested to him that she had probably been informed by isabella of his purpose he doubted whether her retirement to the convent did not import an intention of remaining there until she could raise obstacles to their divorce and the suspicions he had already entertained of jerome made him apprehend that the friar would not only traverse his views but might have inspired hippolita with the resolution of taking sanctuary impatient to unravel this clue and to defeat its success manfred hastened to the convent and arrived there as the friar was earnestly exhorting the princess never to yield to the divorce,2
madam said manfred what business drew you hither why did you not await my return from the marquis,2
i came to implore a blessing on your councils replied hippolita,2
my councils do not need a friars intervention said manfred and of all men living is that hoary traitor the only one whom you delight to confer with,2
profane prince said jerome is it at the altar that thou choosest to insult the servants of the altarbut manfred thy impious schemes are known heaven and this virtuous lady know themnay frown not prince the church despises thy menaces her thunders will be heard above thy wrath dare to proceed in thy cursed purpose of a divorce until her sentence be known and here i lance her anathema at thy head,2
audacious rebel said manfred endeavouring to conceal the awe with which the friars words inspired him dost thou presume to threaten thy lawful prince,2
thou art no lawful prince said jerome thou art no princego discuss thy claim with frederic and when that is done,2
it is done replied manfred frederic accepts matildas hand and is content to waive his claim unless i have no male issueas he spoke those words three drops of blood fell from the nose of alfonsos statue manfred turned pale and the princess sank on her knees,2
behold said the friar mark this miraculous indication that the blood of alfonso will never mix with that of manfred,2
my gracious lord said hippolita let us submit ourselves to heaven think not thy ever obedient wife rebels against thy authority i have no will but that of my lord and the church to that revered tribunal let us appeal it does not depend on us to burst the bonds that unite us if the church shall approve the dissolution of our marriage be it soi have but few years and those of sorrow to pass where can they be worn away so well as at the foot of this altar in prayers for thine and matildas safety,2
but thou shalt not remain here until then said manfred repair with me to the castle and there i will advise on the proper measures for a divorcebut this meddling friar comes not thither my hospitable roof shall never more harbour a traitorand for thy reverences offspring continued he i banish him from my dominions he i ween is no sacred personage nor under the protection of the church whoever weds isabella it shall not be father falconaras startedup son,2
they start up said the friar who are suddenly beheld in the seat of lawful princes but they wither away like the grass and their place knows them no more,2
manfred casting a look of scorn at the friar led hippolita forth but at the door of the church whispered one of his attendants to remain concealed about the convent and bring him instant notice if any one from the castle should repair thither,2
every reflection which manfred made on the friars behaviour conspired to persuade him that jerome was privy to an amour between isabella and theodore but jeromes new presumption so dissonant from his former meekness suggested still deeper apprehensions the prince even suspected that the friar depended on some secret support from frederic whose arrival coinciding with the novel appearance of theodore seemed to bespeak a correspondence still more was he troubled with the resemblance of theodore to alfonsos portrait the latter he knew had unquestionably died without issue frederic had consented to bestow isabella on him these contradictions agitated his mind with numberless pangs,2
he saw but two methods of extricating himself from his difficulties the one was to resign his dominions to the marquispride ambition and his reliance on ancient prophecies which had pointed out a possibility of his preserving them to his posterity combated that thought the other was to press his marriage with isabella after long ruminating on these anxious thoughts as he marched silently with hippolita to the castle he at last discoursed with that princess on the subject of his disquiet and used every insinuating and plausible argument to extract her consent to even her promise of promoting the divorce hippolita needed little persuasions to bend her to his pleasure she endeavoured to win him over to the measure of resigning his dominions but finding her exhortations fruitless she assured him that as far as her conscience would allow she would raise no opposition to a separation though without better founded scruples than what he yet alleged she would not engage to be active in demanding it,2
this compliance though inadequate was sufficient to raise manfreds hopes he trusted that his power and wealth would easily advance his suit at the court of rome whither he resolved to engage frederic to take a journey on purpose that prince had discovered so much passion for matilda that manfred hoped to obtain all he wished by holding out or withdrawing his daughters charms according as the marquis should appear more or less disposed to cooperate in his views even the absence of frederic would be a material point gained until he could take further measures for his security,2
dismissing hippolita to her apartment he repaired to that of the marquis but crossing the great hall through which he was to pass he met bianca the damsel he knew was in the confidence of both the young ladies it immediately occurred to him to sift her on the subject of isabella and theodore calling her aside into the recess of the oriel window of the hall and soothing her with many fair words and promises he demanded of her whether she knew aught of the state of isabellas affections,2
i my lord no my lordyes my lordpoor lady she is wonderfully alarmed about her fathers wounds but i tell her he will do well dont your highness think so,2
i do not ask you replied manfred what she thinks about her father but you are in her secrets come be a good girl and tell me is there any young manhayou understand me,2
lord bless me understand your highness no not i i told her a few vulnerary herbs and repose,2
i am not talking replied the prince impatiently about her father i know he will do well,2
bless me i rejoice to hear your highness say so for though i thought it not right to let my young lady despond methought his greatness had a wan look and a somethingi remember when young ferdinand was wounded by the venetian,2
thou answerest from the point interrupted manfred but here take this jewel perhaps that may fix thy attentionnay no reverences my favour shall not stop herecome tell me truly how stands isabellas heart,2
well your highness has such a way said bianca to be surebut can your highness keep a secret if it should ever come out of your lips,2
by my halidame if it should ever be known that i said it,2
why truth is truth i do not think my lady isabella ever much affectioned my young lord your son yet he was a sweet youth as one should see i am sure if i had been a princessbut bless me i must attend my lady matilda she will marvel what is become of me,2
stay cried manfred thou hast not satisfied my question hast thou ever carried any message any letter,2
i good gracious cried bianca i carry a letter i would not to be a queen i hope your highness thinks though i am poor i am honest did your highness never hear what count marsigli offered me when he came a wooing to my lady matilda,2
i have not leisure said manfred to listen to thy tale i do not question thy honesty but it is thy duty to conceal nothing from me how long has isabella been acquainted with theodore,2
nay there is nothing can escape your highness said bianca not that i know any thing of the matter theodore to be sure is a proper young man and as my lady matilda says the very image of good alfonso has not your highness remarked it,2
yes yesnothou torturest me said manfred where did they meet when,2
no no not matilda isabella when did isabella first become acquainted with this theodore,2
thou dost know said manfred and i must know i will,2
lord your highness is not jealous of young theodore said bianca,2
jealous no no why should i be jealous perhaps i mean to unite themif i were sure isabella would have no repugnance,2
repugnance no ill warrant her said bianca he is as comely a youth as ever trod on christian ground we are all in love with him there is not a soul in the castle but would be rejoiced to have him for our princei mean when it shall please heaven to call your highness to itself,2
indeed said manfred has it gone so far oh this cursed friarbut i must not lose timego bianca attend isabella but i charge thee not a word of what has passed find out how she is affected towards theodore bring me good news and that ring has a companion wait at the foot of the winding staircase i am going to visit the marquis and will talk further with thee at my return,2
manfred after some general conversation desired frederic to dismiss the two knights his companions having to talk with him on urgent affairs,2
as soon as they were alone he began in artful guise to sound the marquis on the subject of matilda and finding him disposed to his wish he let drop hints on the difficulties that would attend the celebration of their marriage unlessat that instant bianca burst into the room with a wildness in her look and gestures that spoke the utmost terror,2
oh my lord my lord cried she we are all undone it is come again it is come again,2
oh the hand the giant the handsupport me i am terrified out of my senses cried bianca i will not sleep in the castle tonight where shall i go my things may come after me tomorrowwould i had been content to wed francesco this comes of ambition,2
what has terrified thee thus young woman said the marquis thou art safe here be not alarmed,2
oh your greatness is wonderfully good said bianca but i dare notno pray let me goi had rather leave everything behind me than stay another hour under this roof,2
go to thou hast lost thy senses said manfred interrupt us not we were communing on important mattersmy lord this wench is subject to fitscome with me bianca,2
oh the saints no said bianca for certain it comes to warn your highness why should it appear to me else i say my prayers morning and eveningoh if your highness had believed diego tis the same hand that he saw the foot to in the gallerychamberfather jerome has often told us the prophecy would be out one of these daysbianca said he mark my words,2
thou ravest said manfred in a rage be gone and keep these fooleries to frighten thy companions,2
what my lord cried bianca do you think i have seen nothing go to the foot of the great stairs yourselfas i live i saw it,2
saw what tell us fair maid what thou hast seen said frederic,2
can your highness listen said manfred to the delirium of a silly wench who has heard stories of apparitions until she believes them,2
this is more than fancy said the marquis her terror is too natural and too strongly impressed to be the work of imagination tell us fair maiden what it is has moved thee thus,2
yes my lord thank your greatness said bianca i believe i look very pale i shall be better when i have recovered myselfi was going to my lady isabellas chamber by his highnesss order,2
we do not want the circumstances interrupted manfred since his highness will have it so proceed but be brief,2
lord your highness thwarts one so replied bianca i fear my hairi am sure i never in my lifewell as i was telling your greatness i was going by his highnesss order to my lady isabellas chamber she lies in the watchetcoloured chamber on the right hand one pair of stairs so when i came to the great stairsi was looking on his highnesss present here,2
grant me patience said manfred will this wench never come to the point what imports it to the marquis that i gave thee a bauble for thy faithful attendance on my daughter we want to know what thou sawest,2
i was going to tell your highness said bianca if you would permit me so as i was rubbing the ringi am sure i had not gone up three steps but i heard the rattling of armour for all the world such a clatter as diego says he heard when the giant turned him about in the gallerychamber,2
what giant is this my lord said the marquis is your castle haunted by giants and goblins,2
lord what has not your greatness heard the story of the giant in the gallerychamber cried bianca i marvel his highness has not told you mayhap you do not know there is a prophecy,2
this trifling is intolerable interrupted manfred let us dismiss this silly wench my lord we have more important affairs to discuss,2
by your favour said frederic these are no trifles the enormous sabre i was directed to in the wood yon casque its felloware these visions of this poor maidens brain,2
so jaquez thinks may it please your greatness said bianca he says this moon will not be out without our seeing some strange revolution for my part i should not be surprised if it was to happen tomorrow for as i was saying when i heard the clattering of armour i was all in a cold sweat i looked up and if your greatness will believe me i saw upon the uppermost banister of the great stairs a hand in armour as big as big i thought i should have swooned i never stopped until i came hitherwould i were well out of this castle my lady matilda told me but yestermorning that her highness hippolita knows something,2
thou art an insolent cried manfred lord marquis it much misgives me that this scene is concerted to affront me are my own domestics suborned to spread tales injurious to my honour pursue your claim by manly daring or let us bury our feuds as was proposed by the intermarriage of our children but trust me it ill becomes a prince of your bearing to practise on mercenary wenches,2
i scorn your imputation said frederic until this hour i never set eyes on this damsel i have given her no jewel my lord my lord your conscience your guilt accuses you and would throw the suspicion on me but keep your daughter and think no more of isabella the judgments already fallen on your house forbid me matching into it,2
manfred alarmed at the resolute tone in which frederic delivered these words endeavoured to pacify him dismissing bianca he made such submissions to the marquis and threw in such artful encomiums on matilda that frederic was once more staggered however as his passion was of so recent a date it could not at once surmount the scruples he had conceived he had gathered enough from biancas discourse to persuade him that heaven declared itself against manfred the proposed marriages too removed his claim to a distance and the principality of otranto was a stronger temptation than the contingent reversion of it with matilda still he would not absolutely recede from his engagements but purposing to gain time he demanded of manfred if it was true in fact that hippolita consented to the divorce the prince transported to find no other obstacle and depending on his influence over his wife assured the marquis it was so and that he might satisfy himself of the truth from her own mouth,2
as they were thus discoursing word was brought that the banquet was prepared manfred conducted frederic to the great hall where they were received by hippolita and the young princesses manfred placed the marquis next to matilda and seated himself between his wife and isabella hippolita comported herself with an easy gravity but the young ladies were silent and melancholy manfred who was determined to pursue his point with the marquis in the remainder of the evening pushed on the feast until it waxed late affecting unrestrained gaiety and plying frederic with repeated goblets of wine the latter more upon his guard than manfred wished declined his frequent challenges on pretence of his late loss of blood while the prince to raise his own disordered spirits and to counterfeit unconcern indulged himself in plentiful draughts though not to the intoxication of his senses,2
the evening being far advanced the banquet concluded manfred would have withdrawn with frederic but the latter pleading weakness and want of repose retired to his chamber gallantly telling the prince that his daughter should amuse his highness until himself could attend him manfred accepted the party and to the no small grief of isabella accompanied her to her apartment matilda waited on her mother to enjoy the freshness of the evening on the ramparts of the castle,2
soon as the company were dispersed their several ways frederic quitting his chamber inquired if hippolita was alone and was told by one of her attendants who had not noticed her going forth that at that hour she generally withdrew to her oratory where he probably would find her the marquis during the repast had beheld matilda with increase of passion he now wished to find hippolita in the disposition her lord had promised the portents that had alarmed him were forgotten in his desires stealing softly and unobserved to the apartment of hippolita he entered it with a resolution to encourage her acquiescence to the divorce having perceived that manfred was resolved to make the possession of isabella an unalterable condition before he would grant matilda to his wishes,2
the marquis was not surprised at the silence that reigned in the princesss apartment concluding her as he had been advertised in her oratory he passed on the door was ajar the evening gloomy and overcast pushing open the door gently he saw a person kneeling before the altar as he approached nearer it seemed not a woman but one in a long woollen weed whose back was towards him the person seemed absorbed in prayer the marquis was about to return when the figure rising stood some moments fixed in meditation without regarding him the marquis expecting the holy person to come forth and meaning to excuse his uncivil interruption said,2
hippolita replied a hollow voice camest thou to this castle to seek hippolita and then the figure turning slowly round discovered to frederic the fleshless jaws and empty sockets of a skeleton wrapt in a hermits cowl,2
deserve their protection said the spectre frederic falling on his knees adjured the phantom to take pity on him,2
dost thou not remember me said the apparition remember the wood of joppa,2
art thou that holy hermit cried frederic trembling can i do aught for thy eternal peace,2
wast thou delivered from bondage said the spectre to pursue carnal delights hast thou forgotten the buried sabre and the behest of heaven engraven on it,2
i have not i have not said frederic but say blest spirit what is thy errand to me what remains to be done,2
frederics blood froze in his veins for some minutes he remained motionless then falling prostrate on his face before the altar he besought the intercession of every saint for pardon a flood of tears succeeded to this transport and the image of the beauteous matilda rushing in spite of him on his thoughts he lay on the ground in a conflict of penitence and passion ere he could recover from this agony of his spirits the princess hippolita with a taper in her hand entered the oratory alone seeing a man without motion on the floor she gave a shriek concluding him dead her fright brought frederic to himself rising suddenly his face bedewed with tears he would have rushed from her presence but hippolita stopping him conjured him in the most plaintive accents to explain the cause of his disorder and by what strange chance she had found him there in that posture,2
ah virtuous princess said the marquis penetrated with grief and stopped,2
for the love of heaven my lord said hippolita disclose the cause of this transport what mean these doleful sounds this alarming exclamation on my name what woes has heaven still in store for the wretched hippolita yet silent by every pitying angel i adjure thee noble prince continued she falling at his feet to disclose the purport of what lies at thy heart i see thou feelest for me thou feelest the sharp pangs that thou inflictestspeak for pity does aught thou knowest concern my child,2
i cannot speak cried frederic bursting from her oh matilda,2
quitting the princess thus abruptly he hastened to his own apartment at the door of it he was accosted by manfred who flushed by wine and love had come to seek him and to propose to waste some hours of the night in music and revelling frederic offended at an invitation so dissonant from the mood of his soul pushed him rudely aside and entering his chamber flung the door intemperately against manfred and bolted it inwards the haughty prince enraged at this unaccountable behaviour withdrew in a frame of mind capable of the most fatal excesses as he crossed the court he was met by the domestic whom he had planted at the convent as a spy on jerome and theodore this man almost breathless with the haste he had made informed his lord that theodore and some lady from the castle were at that instant in private conference at the tomb of alfonso in st nicholass church he had dogged theodore thither but the gloominess of the night had prevented his discovering who the woman was,2
manfred whose spirits were inflamed and whom isabella had driven from her on his urging his passion with too little reserve did not doubt but the inquietude she had expressed had been occasioned by her impatience to meet theodore provoked by this conjecture and enraged at her father he hastened secretly to the great church gliding softly between the aisles and guided by an imperfect gleam of moonshine that shone faintly through the illuminated windows he stole towards the tomb of alfonso to which he was directed by indistinct whispers of the persons he sought the first sounds he could distinguish were,2
does it alas depend on me manfred will never permit our union,2
no this shall prevent it cried the tyrant drawing his dagger and plunging it over her shoulder into the bosom of the person that spoke,2
ah me i am slain cried matilda sinking good heaven receive my soul,2
savage inhuman monster what hast thou done cried theodore rushing on him and wrenching his dagger from him,2
stop stop thy impious hand cried matilda it is my father,2
manfred waking as from a trance beat his breast twisted his hands in his locks and endeavoured to recover his dagger from theodore to despatch himself theodore scarce less distracted and only mastering the transports of his grief to assist matilda had now by his cries drawn some of the monks to his aid while part of them endeavoured in concert with the afflicted theodore to stop the blood of the dying princess the rest prevented manfred from laying violent hands on himself,2
matilda resigning herself patiently to her fate acknowledged with looks of grateful love the zeal of theodore yet oft as her faintness would permit her speech its way she begged the assistants to comfort her father jerome by this time had learnt the fatal news and reached the church his looks seemed to reproach theodore but turning to manfred he said,2
now tyrant behold the completion of woe fulfilled on thy impious and devoted head the blood of alfonso cried to heaven for vengeance and heaven has permitted its altar to be polluted by assassination that thou mightest shed thy own blood at the foot of that princes sepulchre,2
cruel man cried matilda to aggravate the woes of a parent may heaven bless my father and forgive him as i do my lord my gracious sire dost thou forgive thy child indeed i came not hither to meet theodore i found him praying at this tomb whither my mother sent me to intercede for thee for herdearest father bless your child and say you forgive her,2
forgive thee murderous monster cried manfred can assassins forgive i took thee for isabella but heaven directed my bloody hand to the heart of my child oh matildai cannot utter itcanst thou forgive the blindness of my rage,2
i can i do and may heaven confirm it said matilda but while i have life to ask itoh my mother what will she feel will you comfort her my lord will you not put her away indeed she loves you oh i am faint bear me to the castle can i live to have her close my eyes,2
theodore and the monks besought her earnestly to suffer herself to be borne into the convent but her instances were so pressing to be carried to the castle that placing her on a litter they conveyed her thither as she requested theodore supporting her head with his arm and hanging over her in an agony of despairing love still endeavoured to inspire her with hopes of life jerome on the other side comforted her with discourses of heaven and holding a crucifix before her which she bathed with innocent tears prepared her for her passage to immortality manfred plunged in the deepest affliction followed the litter in despair,2
ere they reached the castle hippolita informed of the dreadful catastrophe had flown to meet her murdered child but when she saw the afflicted procession the mightiness of her grief deprived her of her senses and she fell lifeless to the earth in a swoon isabella and frederic who attended her were overwhelmed in almost equal sorrow matilda alone seemed insensible to her own situation every thought was lost in tenderness for her mother,2
ordering the litter to stop as soon as hippolita was brought to herself she asked for her father he approached unable to speak matilda seizing his hand and her mothers locked them in her own and then clasped them to her heart manfred could not support this act of pathetic piety he dashed himself on the ground and cursed the day he was born isabella apprehensive that these struggles of passion were more than matilda could support took upon herself to order manfred to be borne to his apartment while she caused matilda to be conveyed to the nearest chamber hippolita scarce more alive than her daughter was regardless of everything but her but when the tender isabellas care would have likewise removed her while the surgeons examined matildas wound she cried,2
remove me never never i lived but in her and will expire with her,2
matilda raised her eyes at her mothers voice but closed them again without speaking her sinking pulse and the damp coldness of her hand soon dispelled all hopes of recovery theodore followed the surgeons into the outer chamber and heard them pronounce the fatal sentence with a transport equal to frenzy,2
since she cannot live mine cried he at least she shall be mine in death father jerome will you not join our hands cried he to the friar who with the marquis had accompanied the surgeons,2
what means thy distracted rashness said jerome is this an hour for marriage,2
it is it is cried theodore alas there is no other,2
young man thou art too unadvised said frederic dost thou think we are to listen to thy fond transports in this hour of fate what pretensions hast thou to the princess,2
those of a prince said theodore of the sovereign of otranto this reverend man my father has informed me who i am,2
thou ravest said the marquis there is no prince of otranto but myself now manfred by murder by sacrilegious murder has forfeited all pretensions,2
my lord said jerome assuming an air of command he tells you true it was not my purpose the secret should have been divulged so soon but fate presses onward to its work what his hotheaded passion has revealed my tongue confirms know prince that when alfonso set sail for the holy land,2
is this a season for explanations cried theodore father come and unite me to the princess she shall be mine in every other thing i will dutifully obey you my life my adored matilda continued theodore rushing back into the inner chamber will you not be mine will you not bless your,2
isabella made signs to him to be silent apprehending the princess was near her end,2
the violence of his exclamations brought matilda to herself lifting up her eyes she looked round for her mother,2
life of my soul i am here cried hippolita think not i will quit thee,2
oh you are too good said matilda but weep not for me my mother i am going where sorrow never dwellsisabella thou hast loved me wouldst thou not supply my fondness to this dear dear woman indeed i am faint,2
oh my child my child said hippolita in a flood of tears can i not withhold thee a moment,2
it will not be said matilda commend me to heavenwhere is my father forgive him dearest motherforgive him my death it was an error oh i had forgottendearest mother i vowed never to see theodore moreperhaps that has drawn down this calamitybut it was not intentionalcan you pardon me,2
oh wound not my agonising soul said hippolita thou never couldst offend mealas she faints help help,2
i would say something more said matilda struggling but it cannot beisabellatheodorefor my sakeoh she expired,2
isabella and her women tore hippolita from the corse but theodore threatened destruction to all who attempted to remove him from it he printed a thousand kisses on her claycold hands and uttered every expression that despairing love could dictate,2
isabella in the meantime was accompanying the afflicted hippolita to her apartment but in the middle of the court they were met by manfred who distracted with his own thoughts and anxious once more to behold his daughter was advancing to the chamber where she lay as the moon was now at its height he read in the countenances of this unhappy company the event he dreaded,2
what is she dead cried he in wild confusion a clap of thunder at that instant shook the castle to its foundations the earth rocked and the clank of more than mortal armour was heard behind frederic and jerome thought the last day was at hand the latter forcing theodore along with them rushed into the court the moment theodore appeared the walls of the castle behind manfred were thrown down with a mighty force and the form of alfonso dilated to an immense magnitude appeared in the centre of the ruins,2
behold in theodore the true heir of alfonso said the vision and having pronounced those words accompanied by a clap of thunder it ascended solemnly towards heaven where the clouds parting asunder the form of st nicholas was seen and receiving alfonsos shade they were soon wrapt from mortal eyes in a blaze of glory,2
the beholders fell prostrate on their faces acknowledging the divine will the first that broke silence was hippolita,2
my lord said she to the desponding manfred behold the vanity of human greatness conrad is gone matilda is no more in theodore we view the true prince of otranto by what miracle he is so i know notsuffice it to us our doom is pronounced shall we not can we but dedicate the few deplorable hours we have to live in deprecating the further wrath of heaven heaven ejects uswhither can we fly but to yon holy cells that yet offer us a retreat,2
thou guiltless but unhappy woman unhappy by my crimes replied manfred my heart at last is open to thy devout admonitions oh couldbut it cannot beye are lost in wonderlet me at last do justice on myself to heap shame on my own head is all the satisfaction i have left to offer to offended heaven my story has drawn down these judgments let my confession atonebut ah what can atone for usurpation and a murdered child a child murdered in a consecrated place list sirs and may this bloody record be a warning to future tyrants,2
alfonso ye all know died in the holy landye would interrupt me ye would say he came not fairly to his endit is most truewhy else this bitter cup which manfred must drink to the dregs ricardo my grandfather was his chamberlaini would draw a veil over my ancestors crimesbut it is in vain alfonso died by poison a fictitious will declared ricardo his heir his crimes pursued himyet he lost no conrad no matilda i pay the price of usurpation for all a storm overtook him haunted by his guilt he vowed to st nicholas to found a church and two convents if he lived to reach otranto the sacrifice was accepted the saint appeared to him in a dream and promised that ricardos posterity should reign in otranto until the rightful owner should be grown too large to inhabit the castle and as long as issue male from ricardos loins should remain to enjoy italas alas nor male nor female except myself remains of all his wretched race i have donethe woes of these three days speak the rest how this young man can be alfonsos heir i know notyet i do not doubt it his are these dominions i resign themyet i knew not alfonso had an heiri question not the will of heavenpoverty and prayer must fill up the woeful space until manfred shall be summoned to ricardo,2
what remains is my part to declare said jerome when alfonso set sail for the holy land he was driven by a storm to the coast of sicily the other vessel which bore ricardo and his train as your lordship must have heard was separated from him,2
it is most true said manfred and the title you give me is more than an outcast can claimwell be it soproceed,2
jerome blushed and continued for three months lord alfonso was windbound in sicily there he became enamoured of a fair virgin named victoria he was too pious to tempt her to forbidden pleasures they were married yet deeming this amour incongruous with the holy vow of arms by which he was bound he determined to conceal their nuptials until his return from the crusade when he purposed to seek and acknowledge her for his lawful wife he left her pregnant during his absence she was delivered of a daughter but scarce had she felt a mothers pangs ere she heard the fatal rumour of her lords death and the succession of ricardo what could a friendless helpless woman do would her testimony availyet my lord i have an authentic writing,2
it needs not said manfred the horrors of these days the vision we have but now seen all corroborate thy evidence beyond a thousand parchments matildas death and my expulsion,2
be composed my lord said hippolita this holy man did not mean to recall your griefs jerome proceeded,2
i shall not dwell on what is needless the daughter of which victoria was delivered was at her maturity bestowed in marriage on me victoria died and the secret remained locked in my breast theodores narrative has told the rest,2
the friar ceased the disconsolate company retired to the remaining part of the castle in the morning manfred signed his abdication of the principality with the approbation of hippolita and each took on them the habit of religion in the neighbouring convents frederic offered his daughter to the new prince which hippolitas tenderness for isabella concurred to promote but theodores grief was too fresh to admit the thought of another love and it was not until after frequent discourses with isabella of his dear matilda that he was persuaded he could know no happiness but in the society of one with whom he could for ever indulge the melancholy that had taken possession of his soul,2

author of pastorals of dorset the duenna of a genius etc etc,0
university press john wilson and son cambridge u s a,0
under whose auspices i first became acquainted with the peculiarities of its dialect and the humours of its people,0
prologue page the bride part i the sleeping beauty part ii the prince,0
a man of reverend age but stout and hale,0
the sale was over live stock implements corn and hay turnips and potatoes even apples had duly been entered to their various buyers and now such smaller articles as milkpails cheesetubs creamtins weights and scales and other items of a dairyfarmers gear were passing under the hammer the auction had been well attended for it had been known beforehand that things would go cheap and though the melancholy circumstances under which the sale took place called forth many expressions of regret and compassion they in no way lessened the general eagerness to secure good bargains,0
old giles stelling had always kept pace with the times and had been among the first to adopt new appliances and avail himself of the lights which advancing science throws even upon the avocations of the farmer he had gone a little too fast as his neighbours now agreed with many doleful ahs and ayes and shakings of heads all these grand new machines of his had helped to precipitate the catastrophe which had overtaken hima catastrophe which was tragic indeed for the old farmer overcome by the prospect of impending ruin had been carried off by an apoplectic fit even before this enforced sale of his effects,0
nevertheless though many considered these strange newfangled reapersandbinders these unnaturallooking doubleploughs a kind of flying in the face of providence a few spirited individuals had made up their minds to bid for them and one energetic purchaser had even driven eighteen miles from the other side of the county to secure one particularly complicated machine,0
the bidding was still proceeding briskly in the great barn when this person shouldered his way through the crowd and made a tour of inspection of the premises previous to setting forth again on his return journey he was a middlesized elderly man with bright blue eyes that looked forth kindly if keenly from beneath bushy grizzled brows the ruddy face set off by a fringe of white beard and whisker looked goodhumoured and prosperous enough but the somewhat stooping shoulders bore witness to the constant and arduous labour which had been elias fianders lot in early life,0
he sauntered across the great yard so desolate today albeit crowded at the upper end nearest the barn the suspension of the ordinary life of the place gave it an air of supreme melancholy and even loneliness the cattle thrusting at each other in their enclosures and bellowing dismally the sheep hurdled off in convenient lots the very fowl penned up and squawking lamentably for the more valuable specimens were tied together in bunches by the legsall these dumb things seemed to have a kind of instinctive understanding that something unusual and tragic was going forward,0
poor beasts they do make a deal o noise muttered elias half aloud a body might think they was acryin for their master well well t is an ill wind what blows nobody good and that there turniphoer was a wonderful bargain it wont do him no harm as i should ha picked it up so cheap nay nay t wont do him no harm where he be gone to and i might as well ha bought it as another,0
having satisfied a passing twinge of conscience with this reflection he stepped into the great rickyard and stood a moment gazing from one to the other of the golden and russet stacks,0
prime stuff he muttered to himself that be real old hay in the corner and this here wheatricktheres a goodish lot o money in that or im much mistaken here be another half thrashedah fine stuff t is a pity the poor old master did nt live to see the end o that jobthough if the money were nt agoin into his own pocket he wouldnt ha been much the better for t,0
he was wandering round the rick in question gazing at it from every point and even thrusting his hands upwards into the loosened sheaves of that portion which had been unroofed and partially thrashed when a sudden rustle close to him made him start,0
lo perched high upon the ledge of the halfdemolished stack a figure was standing kneedeep among the roughly piledup sheaves the tall and shapely figure of a young girl she was dressed in black and from under the wide sombre brim of her straw hat a pair of blue eyes looked down fiercely at the farmer the face in which they were set was oval in shape and at that moment very pale the lips were parted showing a gleam of white teeth,0
why my dear said fiander stepping a little further away from the stack and gazing up at her in mild astonishmentwhy whatever might you be doin up there you did gi me quite a start i do assure ye,0
im looking at something i dont like to see returned the girl in a choked voice and her bosom heaved with a quick angry sob,0
ah said the other tentatively setting his hat a little further back on his head and wrinkling up his eyes he examined her more closely the black dress the wrathful miserable face told their own tale i do low ye be somebody belongin to the poor old master he continued respectfully,0
ah said fiander again with a world of sympathy in his blue eyes t is a melancholy sight for ye sure youre mr stellings daughter very like,0
dear heart alive t is sadt is very sad for ye miss but im sure id never keep astandin on the stack frettin yourself so i would nt truly t is a very sad business altogether miss stelling but youll be upsettin yourself worse if ye bide here,0
the girl stepped across the sheaves and drew near the edge of the stack fiander stretched out his hand to assist her down,0
thats it he remarked encouragingly im main glad to see you are so sensible and ready to take advice miss stelling here let me help ye down,0
no thank you she replied and my name is nt stelling,0
stooping and supporting herself with one hand against the edge of the ledge she swung herself gracefully down her hat dropping off as she did so the face thus exposed to view proved even younger than fiander had anticipated and were he a more impressionable man he might well have been startled at its beauty,0
even though he had attained the respectable age of fiftyeight and had not long buried a most faithful and hardworking helpmate the worthy farmer was conscious of a glow of admiration though the girls eyes were blue the hair and brows were distinctly dark and the complexion of the brunette ordera combination somewhat unusual and very striking her figure was as has been said tall and slight yet with vigour as well as grace in every movement she alighted on the ground as easily and as lightly as though she had been a bird,0
well done ejaculated fiander and what might your name be if it baint stelling,0
my name is goldring she replied a little haughtily rosalie goldring my mother was mr stellings daughter,0
well now returned the farmer smiling cheerfully goldring and thats a pretty name tooparticlar for a maida token i might say rosalie did you tell me miss i do mind a song as i used to hear when i were a boy about rosalie the prairie flower she had picked up her hat and stood gazing at him discontentedly,0
i suppose everything is sold by this time she said my dear grandfathers mare and the trap and even my cocks and hens dear grandfather he always used to tell me that everything in the whole place was to be mine when he diedand now they wont so much as leave me the old rooster,0
poor maid ejaculated fiander full of commiseration and guiltily conscious of having bought that turniphoer a bargain t is unfortnate for ye im sure did nt your grandfather make no provision for ee,0
oh it is nt that i mind retorted rosalie quickly its seeing everything go everything that i loveall the live things that i knew and used to take care ofeven my churn and my cheesepressesgranfer used always to say i was wonderful about cheesemakingand the pails and pans out of my dairyeverything that i kept so nice and took such pride in theyll all go to strangers nowall scattered about one here one there and tomorrow theyll be selling the things out of the house if they leave me the clothes i stand up in thatll be all,0
she sobbed so pitifully and looked so forlorn that fianders heart was positively wrung,0
my word he ejaculated i do low its hardt is that t is cruel hard what was ye thinkin o doin my dear youll have some relations most like as ll be glad to take ye in,0
i have nt a relation in the world returned rosalie with another sob i had nobody but grandfather if i had she added quickly i dont know that i should have gone to themi dont like to be beholden to anybody ill earn my own bread though i dont know how i shall do it grandfather could never bear the notion of my going to service,0
no indeed of course when he was alive we never thought of things coming to this pass he always told me i should be mistress here when he was gone and that i should be well off dear granfer he grudged me nothing,0
such a good education as he gied ye too observed elias commiseratingly,0
oh yes i was at boardingschool for three years i can play the piano and work the crewelwork and i learnt french,0
dear heart alive groaned fiander and now ye be athrown upon the world but i was meanin another kind of education cheesemaking and dairywork and thatyou was sayin you was a good hand at suchlike while he spoke he eyed her sharply and listened eagerly for the response,0
yes yes agreed rosalie i can do all that we made all kinds of cheeses every day in the winter ramil and haskim and blue vinny and all yes i was kept busymy butter always took top price in the market and then there were the accounts to make up of an evening my life was nt all play i can tell you but i was very happy,0
my missus remarked fiander following out his own train of thoughtsthats the second one i buried her a year come michaelmasshe was a wonderful hand at the haskim cheeses a very stirring body she was i do miss her dreadful and these here dairywomen as ye hire they be terrible folk for wasteterrible i reckon ill be a lot out of pocket this year,0
we all have our troubles you see said rosalie with tears still hanging on her black lashes well i thank you for your kind words sir they seem to have done me good i think ill go in now i dont want to meet any of the folk,0
bide a bit my dear said the farmer bide a bit ive summat to ax ye you baint thinkin of going to service ye say and ye dont rightly know where to look for a home,0
rosalie stared at him he was laughing in a confused awkward way and his face was growing redder and redder before she could answer he went on,0

his blue eyes were nearly jumping out of his head his honest face was all puckered into smiles,0
come he cried t is an offer here be i an old one yet not so very old neither and uncommon tough i wants a missus terrible bad ive abeen on the lookout for one this halfyear but i did nt expect to take up with a leading article like you well and ye be lookin for a home and ye baint akeepin company wi nobody i d make ye so comfortable as ever i could i d not grudge ye nothing no more than your grandfather ive aworked hard all my life and ive got together a nice bit o money and bought my farm theres seventy head of milch cows on it now not to speak o young beasts and pigs and that ye might be missus there and make so many cheeses as ever ye pleased how old might ye be my maid,0
eighteen returned rosalie tremulously she had been gazing at him with large startled eyes but had made no attempt to interrupt him,0
eighteen well and im fiftyeight theres forty years atween us but lord whats forty years i can mind when i were eighteen year of age the same as if t were yesterday and i can mind as i did think myself as old and as wise as i be now come my dear whats forty year im hale and hearty and id be so good to ye as ever i could and you be lonesome and desolatethrown upon the world as i say come lets make it up together comfortable say the word and ye can snap your fingers at anyone who interferes wi ye my place is just so big as thisbigger well now is it a bargain,0
i think it is murmured rosalie ii dont know what else to do and i think you look kind,0
late on that same evening mr fiander reached home and after attending to his horse and casting a cursory glance round to ascertain that nothing had gone wrong in his absence he betook himself across the fields to the house of his next neighbour and great crony isaac sharpe,0
he found his friend seated in the armchair by the chimney corner isaac being a bachelorman paid small heed to the refinements which were recently beginning to be in vogue among his class and habitually sat in the kitchen the old woman who acted as housekeeper to him had gone home and he was alone in the wide flagged room which looked cheerful enough just now lit up as it was by the wood fire which danced gaily on the yellow walls and threw gigantic shadows of the hams and flitches suspended from the great oaken beams on the ceiling he was just in the act of shaking out the ashes from his pipe previous to retiring for the night when elias entered and greeted him with no small astonishment,0
be it you lias i were just agoin to lock up and go to roost,0
elias creaked noisily across the great kitchen and standing opposite sharpe in the chimney corner looked down at him for a moment without speaking the other tapped his pipe on the iron hob nearest him and continued to gaze interrogatively at the newcomer he was about the same age as fiander but looked younger his burly form being straight and his sunburnt face more lightly touched by the hand of time hair beard and whiskers alike abundant were of a uniform pepperandsaltthere being more pepper than salt in the mixture when he smiled he displayed a set of teeth in no less excellent preservation,0
as elias continued to gaze down at him with an odd sheepish expression and without speaking he himself took the initiative,0
ye called round to tell me about the sale i suppose well i take it very kind of ye lias though i was nt for your goin after that newfangled machine i do low yell ha give a big price for t,0
his tone had a tinge of severity and it was noticeable throughout that his attitude towards fiander was somewhat dictatorial though in truth fiander was the older as well as the richer man,0
nay now nay now the latter returned quickly ye be wrong for once isaac t is a wonderful bargain things was goin oncommon cheap there was hurdles to be picked up for next to nothin i were athinkin of you isaac and awishin yed ha comed wi me yes hurdles was goin wonderful cheap theyd ha come in handy for your sheep,0
isaac grunted since he had not thought fit to accompany his friend he was rather annoyed at being told of the bargains he had missed,0
it was a long way to travel he remarked did you have to go into dorchester,0
nay i turned off by yellowham hill banfords about four mile out o dorchester and i cut off a good bit that way,0
well yeve agot the hoer grunted isaac did you bid for anything else,0
no i did nt bid for it returned elias with a sheepish chuckle but ive amet with a wonderful piece of luck out yonder,0
he paused slowly rubbed his hands chuckled again and finally bending down so that his face was on a level with sharpes said slowly and emphatically,0
isaac youll be ahearing summat on sunday as ull surprise ye,0
isaac who from force of habit had replaced his empty pipe in his mouth now took it out gaped at his interlocutor for a full halfminute and finally said,0
what ejaculated isaac in a tone of immeasurable disgust ye be at it again be ye i never did see sich a man for wedlock why this here ull make the third of em,0
come returned elias plaintively thats none of my fault my missuses dont lastthats where t is i did think the last un ud ha done my time but she goes an drops off just at our busiest season if i be so much o a marryin man t is because the lord in his mystreerious ways has seen fit to deal hardly wi i ye know as well as me dont ye isaac as a dairyfarmer cant get on nohow wiout a wife,0
aye t is what ive always said agreed isaac there may be profit in the dairyfarming but theres a deal o risk what wi cows dyin and bein forced to toll a woman about t is more bother nor its worth why did nt ye do same as me and keep sheep and grow roots ah what with roots and what with corn a man can get on as well that way as your wayand theres less risk,0
well ive abeen brought up to it dye see isaacthats it my father was a dairyman before mein a less way to be sure ah it were a struggle for him i tell ye he did ha to pay thirteen pound for every cow he rented of old meatyard what was master then thirteen pound think of that why i used to hear him say as pounds and pounds went through his hands before he could count as hed made a penny,0
ah remarked mr sharpe with the placid interest of one who hears an ofttold tale but then pastures and houserent and all were counted in thatyour father paid no rent for em did he and meatyard found him in cows and kept him in hay and oilcake and that,0
yes agreed elias unwillingly for the enumeration of these extenuating circumstances detracted from the picturesque aspect of the case oh yes he did that but my father he alays said it were a poor way o makin a livin save up lias my boy he alays did use to say to i save up and buy a bit o land for yourself so i scraped and scrimped and laid by and my first missus she were a very thrifty body a very thrifty body she were she put her shoulder to the wheel too and when old meatyard died we bought the farm and things did prosper wi us very well sincetill my last poor wife died then all did go wrong wi i aye as i say if i do seem more set on matrimony than other folks t is because the lord ha marked i out for t now you isaac never was called that way seemingly,0
nay agreed isaac i never were acalled that way i never could do wi womenfolk about ive seed too much of em when i were a young un lord what a catanddog life my poor father and mother did lead to be sure he liked a drop o drink my father did and when hed had a glass too much ive seen my mother pull the hair out of his head by handfulsah that i have but father hed never complain soon as she d leave go of him hed stoop down and pick up all the hair as she d apulled out of his head hed put it in a boxah manys the time heve ashowed it to me arter him and her had had a fallin out and hed say to me never you go fur to get married my boy and id say nay father and ive akept my word,0
your poor sister kep house for you a good bit though did nt she after she lost her husband and you were uncommon fond o the boy,0
yes it be different wi a sisterparticularly one as knows she have nt got no right to be there she were a very quiet body poor eliza were i were quite sorry when she and the little chap shifted to dorchester but she thought shed do better in business,0
well but you were a good friend to she remarked elias both to she and her boy ye paid his passage to merica arter she died poor thing did nt ye,0
ah i did pay his passage to merica and i did gi him a bit o money in hand to start wi out there well but you hant told me the name o your new missus,0
rosalie goldring is her name returned elias lowering his voice confidentially rosalie goldringnice name baint it soons i heard her name i took it for a kind o token,0
ah there be a good many goldrings dorchester side remarked isaac was that what took you off so far away youve been acoortin and never dropped a hint o it,0
nay now i never so much as set eyes on her till this very day but being so bad off for a wife and so put about wi all the waste as is agoin on at my place i thought id make sure o her so i axed her and she were glad enough to take meshes giles stellings granddaughter d ye see and she has to turn out now,0
old stellings granddaughter repeated isaac with emphasis granddaughter he must ha been a terrible old man,0
i do low he wereold enough replied elias hastily well now ive atold ye the news isaac i think i might as well take myself home again my head be all in a whirl wi so much travellin and one thing and another goodnight to ye isaac ye must be sure an come over to see the new turniphoer tomorrow,0
a little more than three weeks later fiander brought home his bride and isaac sharpe cleaned himself and strolled up in the evening to congratulate the couple elias admitted him his face wreathed with smiles and his whole person smartened up and rejuvenated,0
come in isaac come in the wifes gone upstairs to get ready for supper but shell be down in a minute,0
thankee isaac thankee come in and take a chair ye may fill your pipe tooshe does nt object to a pipe,0
who does nt object to a pipe said isaac staring with a great hand on each knee,0
why mrs fiander does nt oh isaac i be afavoured so i told you the amighty had marked me out for wedlock well i can truly say that this here missus promises to be the best o the three wait till ye see her and youll think im in luck,0
isaac gazed at him with a kind of stolid compassion shook his head deliberately filled his pipe and fell to smoking elias did the same and after he had puffed for a moment or two broke silence,0
ah yell find her most agreeble i did mention to her that you be used to drop in of a sunday and she did make no objectionsno objections at all,0
did nt she returned isaac come thats a good thing he paused for a moment the veins in his forehead swelling i dont know but if she had made objections i should nt ha come all the same he continued presently ive acome here sunday arter sunday for twenty year and more it would nt seem very natural to stop away now,0
nay sure agreed fiander nervously t would nt seem at all natural,0
the sound of a light foot was now heard crossing the room overhead and descending the stairs,0
the door opened and a tall wellformed figure stood outlined against the background of firelit kitchen it was almost dusk in the parlour where the two men sat,0
why youre all in the dark here observed a cheerful voice shall i light the lamp elias,0
do my dear do this here be mr isaac sharpe our next neighbour as youve aheard me talk on often isaac heres mrs fiander,0
isaac wedged his pipe firmly into the corner of his mouth and extended a large hand according to the code of manners prevalent in that neighbourhood it was not considered necessary to rise when you greeted a lady,0
how d ye do mum i give you joy he remarked,0
when her hand was released mrs fiander sought and found lamp and matches and removed the shade and chimney always with such quick decided movements that isaac remarked to himself approvingly that she was nt very slack about her work she struck a match bending over the lamp and suddenly the light flared up isaac leaned forward in his favourite attitude a hand on either knee and took a good look at the newcomer then drawing himself back and removing his pipe from his mouth he shot an indignant glance at fiander,0
come that looks more cheerful remarked the unconscious bride and supper will be ready in a minute ill go and get the cloth,0
as she vanished the newmade husband bent over anxiously to his friend,0
what do you think of her he remarked jerking his thumb over his shoulder,0
elias returned his friend wrathfully and reproachfully i did nt expect it of ye no that i did nt at your time of life and arter buryin two of em nay now i did nt think it of you the least you might do was to pick out a staid woman,0
come come retorted fiander shes young but thatll wear off isaacshell mend in time,0
it baint only that she be young resumed sharpe still severe and indignant but i do think lias takin everything into consideration that it ud ha been more natural and more decent i might say for you to ha got married to somebody more suited to ye why man your new missus be a regular beauty,0
aa nichols now laid in his grave bi t side of his fadder and mudder the warl not frae deoth could yen save we a gang offteane after t other,0
sunday noontide and a warm sunday too the little congregation pouring out of the ivygrown church in the hollow seemed to have found the heat within oppressive the men were wiping their moist brows previous to assuming the hard uncompromising hats which alone could do justice to the day and the women fanned themselves with their clean white handkerchiefs or sniffed ostentatiously at the squat oddly shaped bottles of smellingsalts or nosegays of jessamine and southernwood with which they had provided themselves in the village proper sundry nonchurchgoers waited the return of their more pious brethren one or two lads sat expectantly on stiles on the lookout for their respective sweethearts whom they would escort homewards and with whom they would possibly make appointments for a stroll at some later hour of the day children with important faces might be seen returning from the bakehouse carefully carrying the sunday dinner covered with a clean cloth and a few older men and women stood about their doorsteps or leaned over their garden gates with the intention of waylaying their homewardbound neighbours and extracting from them items concerning a very important event which had recently taken place in the vicinity,0
one very fat old lady propping herself with difficulty against the lintel of her door hailed her opposite neighbour eagerly,0
goodday mrs paddock did ye chance to notice if master have agone by yet,0
nay he have nt acome this waynot so far as i know returned the other they do say he takes on terrible about poor mr fiander,0
ah said the first speaker with a longdrawn breath hed be like to i do low seein what friends they was folks d say as fiander have very like left him summat,0
nay nay hell leave it all in a lump to she he thought the world of the missus hell be sure to ha left it to shewiout she marries again thenwell then very like mr sharpe will come in poor mr fiander t is a sad thing to ha never chick nor child to leave your money to,0
ah sure t is a pity they did nt have no children i reckon mr fiander looked to have em seein hed picked out such a fine shapely maid he were a fine man too though he were gettin into years to be sure when he wed her not but what a body ud ha expected the old gentleman to last a good bit longer sixtytwo they d say he were,0
well and thats no age to speak on lord i were that upset when i heerd he were took im not the better of it yet,0
ay t is a terrible visitation all as has hearts must feel it,0
i do assure ye mrs belbin ive scarce closed my eyes since and when i do drop off towards mornin i do dreamt is fearful what i do dream this very night i tell ye i thought the end had come and we was all abein judged yon in church the lord amighty hisself was asittin up in gallery ajudging of we,0
bless me interrupted mrs belbin and what were amighty god like to look on mrs paddock,0
oh he were beautifulwi broad large features and a very piercin eyebut he had a beautiful smile i thought if ye can understand that some was agoin up to the right and some to the left yes we was all bein judged taking our turns squire fust and then his lady and then all the young ladies and gentlemen agoin up one after t other and abein judged,0
well well commented mrs belbin throwing up her eyes and hands all so natural like wa nt it,0
she had evidently been much impressed by the strict order of precedence observed by the actors in this visionary drama,0
did ye see poor farmer fiander inquired the other eagerly,0
nay nay he were nt there strange to say t ud ha been natural to see himhim bein dead ye knowbut he were nt there but i see master abein judged,0
did ye now and where did he go hes a good manhe d be like to go upards were hamworthy therethe butcher i mean i wonder what the amighty ud say to the short weights that he do give us poor folk,0
nay i did nt see him fur it were acomin nigh my turn and i were that afeared i could nt think o nothin else and when i did get up to walk up under gallery i thought my legs did give way and down i plumpedand that did awaken me up,0
well it was a wonderful dream mrs paddock im not surprised as you be feelin a bit poorly today t is astonishing what folks d dream when theyre upset i do assure ye when my stummicks a bit out of order im hagrid all night last sunday t was i did dream i seed a great big toad sittin on piller and i hollered out and hit at him and belbin he cotched me by the hand good gracious says he what best thumpin me like that for why says i baint there a toad on piller nay now says he theres nothin at all but youve ahit me sich a crack upon the chops that ill lay ill have the toothache for a week,0
id never go for to say as dreams did nt mean summat though said mrs paddock,0
aye ive great faith in dreams and tokens and sich ye mind old maria gillingham folks always used to think her a bit of a witch but she never did nobody much harm seemingly it were but the day before she died as i did meet her you look poorly maria says i i be like to be poorly mrs paddock says she im near my end she says i ve had a token you dont tell me says i yes she said i were asittin in chimbly corner just now and three great bluebottles did come flyin in wi crape upon their wings and they did fly three times round my head and they did say soon gone soon gone soon gone,0
ah commented mrs belbin and she were soon gone were nt she,0
she were agreed mrs paddock lugubriously they did find her lyin wi her head under the table next day stone dead but heres rose bundy acomin down the road well rose was the widow in church,0
ay i seed her cried rose a fat redcheeked girl with round black eyes at this moment gleaming with excitement she did have on such lovely weedsye never saw such weeds there was crape on em very nigh all over she did have a great long fall as did come to her knees very near and another much the same ahanging down at the back o her bonnet and her skirt was covered with crapeand i think there was truly more black than white to her hankercher ah it was agoin all the time under her veilfust her eyes and then her nose poor thing she do seem to feel her loss dreadful,0
and well she may said mrs paddock emphatically a good husband same as fiander baint to be picked up every day,0
why he was but a old man retorted the girl mrs fianderll soon have plenty o young chaps acomin to coort her they d say as mr fiander have aleft her every single penny he had to do what she likes wi shell soon take up wi some smart young fellowit is nt in natur to expect a handsome young body same as her to go on frettin for ever after a old man let him be so good as he may,0
nay now nay now cried mrs belbin authoritatively t will be this way as youll soon see mr fiander will ha left the widow his money and farm and all as long as she do be a widow but if she goes for to change her state why then o coorse itll go to somebody else there never was a man livinand more particularly a old oneas could make up his mind to leave his money behind him for a woman to spend on another man thatll be it yell find mrs fianderll keep her money as long as she d keep her mournin,0
here be master now announced her opposite neighbour craning her head a little further out of the doorway the poor man he do look upset and sorrowful,0
the eyes of all the little party fixed themselves on the approaching figure mr sharpe was clad in sunday gear of prosperous broadcloth and wore somewhat on the back of his head a tall hat so antiquated as to shape and so shaggy as to texture that the material of which it was composed may possibly have been beaver his large face was at that moment absolutely devoid of all expression mrs paddocks remark therefore seemed to be dictated by a somewhat lively imagination he nodded absently as the women greeted him which they did very respectfully as both their husbands worked under him but wheeled round after he had passed the group to address mrs paddock,0
ill take those chicken off you as you was aspeakin on if youll fetch em up to my place toweek the fox have atook a lot of mine and i be loath to disappoint my customers,0
ill fetch em up sir so soon as i can these be terrible times mr sharpe baint they sich losses as weve ahad last week the fox he ve abeen terrible mischeevous and poor mr fianderhe were took very unexpected were nt he,0
youll be the one to miss him sir as we was sayin mrs belbin and me mr sharpe ull be the one to miss him ye did use to go there every sunday reglar mr sharpe did nt ye,0
ah agreed the farmer again his large face seemed just as expressionless as before but a close observer might have detected a sudden suffusion of colour to the eyelids,0
they d say as mrs fiander be takin on terrible put in mrs belbin folding her arms across her ample bosom and settling herself for a good chat with an air of melancholy enjoyment she is a nice young womanyes shes that and the marriage did turn out wonderful well though folks did think it a bit foolish o mr fiander to choose sich a young maid at his time o life but he was lonesome poor man losing his first wife so long ago and the children dying so young and his second missus bein took too but well as i d say the last marriage turned out wonderful well there was never a word said again mrs fiander,0
there was never a word to be said returned mr sharpe somewhat sternly,0
yes just what i d say chimed in mrs paddock his chice was a good un she be a nice body mrs fiander be,0
ah agreed the farmer i d low she be a nice plain young woman her husband have aproved that he did think his chice a good un for heve aleft her everything as he had in the world,0
but not if she marries again sir sure cried both the women together,0
lard added mrs belbin hed never ha been sich a sammy as to let her keep everything if she goes for to take another man,0
she be left house and farm stock and money onconditional returned mr sharpe emphatically and he passed on leaving the gossips aghast,0
the time ive lost in wooing in watching and pursuing the light that lies in womans eyes has been my hearts undoing,0
the subject of the conversation recently recorded was slowly removing her blacks and laying them carefully away on the lavenderscented shelves in the desolate upper chamber of the home which had suddenly grown so lonely divested of the flowing mantle the tall wellmoulded figure was set off by its closefitting black robe and the face which had been hidden from view by the thick folds of crape proved able to stand the test of the glaring summer sunshine the adjective plain applied to the widow by her late husbands friend must be taken only in its local sense as signifying simple and straightforward even to the indifferent eyes of this elderly yeoman rosalies beauty had ripened and increased during the four years that had elapsed since her marriage with his friend the black lashes which shaded her lovely eyes were still wet the red lips quivered and the bosom heaved convulsively most of the friends and neighbours of the late mr fiander would have been astonishednot to say scandalisedat the sight of such grief it was quite decent and becoming to cry in church where everybody was looking at you but to cry when you were alone for an old man of sixtytwowhen you had been left in undisputed possession of all his property and might with perfect impunity marry again at the earliest possible opportunityit was not only unreasonable and foolish but rank ingratitude for the most merciful dispensation of providence,0
but mrs fiander continued to sob to herself and to look blankly round the empty room and out at the wide fields where the familiar figure had been wont to roam and when taking the new widows cap from its box she arranged it on the top of her abundant hair she could not repress a fresh gush of tears,0
poor fiander she said to herself he would nt let me wear it if he knew it makes me a perfect fright and is so cumbersome and so much in the way but ill wear it all the same nobody shall say im wanting in respect to his memory dear dear not a week gone yet it seems more like a year,0
she descended the stairs slowly and entered the parlour there was the highbacked chair where fiander used to sit waiting for the sunday midday meal there also was the stool on which he supported his gouty leg opposite was another chair invariably occupied by farmer sharpe on sunday afternoons when after a walk round his neighbours land he came in for a chat and a smoke mrs fiander herself had always sat at the table joining in the conversation from time to time after she had mixed for her husband and his friend the stiff glass of grog of which it was their custom to partake fiander said nobody mixed it so well as she and even mr sharpe occasionally nodded approval and generously agreed that she was a firstrate hand,0
she wondered idly if mr sharpe would come today she almost hoped he would she did not like to walk round the fields alonepeople would think it strange tooand it was so lonely and so dreary sitting by herself in the house,0
but mr sharpes chair remained empty all that afternoon mrs fiander however had other visitors it was getting near teatime and she was looking forward somewhat anxiously to the arrival of that meal which would make a break in the dismal hours when a genteel knock at the door startled her she knew it was not isaac for it was his custom to walk in uninvited and thought it might be some other neighbour coming with a word of comfort she was surprised however when the maid ushered in a tall stout young man whom she recognised as the son of one of the leading tradespeople in the town andrew burges father was indeed not only cab and coach proprietor on a large scale but also undertaker and rosalie now remembered that her actual visitor had taken a prominent part at her husbands funeral,0
i jest called to see how you might be getting on mrs fiander he remarked and to offer my respectful condoliences t was a melancholy occasion where we met last mrs fiander,0
it was indeed said rosalie adding somewhat stiffly take a seat mr burge,0
mr burge took a seatnot one of the ordinary chairs which mrs fiander indicated with a general wave of the hand but poor eliass own particular one which was as has been stated established in the chimneycorner it happened to be directly opposite to the one in which rosalie had been sittingisaac sharpes usual chairand was no doubt chosen by the visitor on account of its agreeable proximity to his hostess anybody more unlike its former occupant it would be hard to imagine andrew was as has been said tall and stout with black eyes closely resembling bootbuttons in size and expression a florid complexion and very sleek black hair he conveyed a general impression of bursting out of his clothes his coat appearing to be too tight his trousers too short his collar too high and his hat when he wore it too small this hat he carefully placed upon the ground between his legs and drew from its crown a large white pockethandkerchief which he flourished almost in a professional manner,0
i feels he went on attuning his voice to the melancholy tone in harmony with this proceedingi feels that any condoliences let them be so sincere as they may falls immaterially short of the occasion the late mr elias fiander was universally respected by the townsfolk of branston as well as by his own immediate neighbours,0
you are very kind said rosalie feeling that she must make a remark and inwardly chiding herself for the frenzied impatience with which she had longed to turn him out of her husbands chair after all the poor young man was unconscious of offence and meant well,0
it was i may say mrs fiander a object of congratulation to me that i was able to pay the deceased a last melancholy tribute praps you did nt chance to observe that it was me druv the earse,0
i knew i had seen you there said the widow in a low voice but i could nt for the moment recollect where,0
it would ha fallen in better wi my own wishes went on andrew if i could ha driven both o you but my father told me you did nt fancy the notion o the jubilee earse,0
you mean that combined hearse and mourning coach cried rosalie no indeed why the coffin is put crosswise behind the drivers legs just like a bale of goods i think its dreadful,0
nay now returned andrew we are most careful to show every respect to the pore corpse the compartment is made specialglazed and all quite beautiful some people thinks it a privilege for the mourners to be sittin behind so close to their dear departed and then think of the expense it savesonly one pair of horses needed you know not but what expense is no object to you and of course your feelins bein o that delicate natur you felt i suppose it would be almost too arrowing,0
i know i could nt bear the idea she cried the jubilee hearse do you call it how came you to give it such a name,0
ah why you see it was entirely my fathers idea and he had it built in the jubilee year he thought you know hed like to do something a little special that year by way of showin his loyalty ah he spared no expense in carryin of it out i do assure ee well as i was sayin mrs fiander it would have been a great pleasure to me to have given you both a token of respect and sympathy at the same time but since it was nt to be i followed what i thought would be most in accordance with your wishes and i showed my respect for your feelins by driving the remains,0
here he flourished the handkerchief again and raised the bootbutton eyes to mrs fianders face,0
i am of course grateful for any tribute of respect to my dear husband she said,0
yes resumed mr burge i thought youd look on it in that light but i should have thought it a privilege to drive you mrs fiander,0
i thought id just call round and explain my motives he went on and also take the opportunity of offering in person my best condoliences,0
i may speak i think remarked andrew pompously in the name of the whole borough of branston there was i might say but one mournful murmur when the noos of his death came to town but one mournful murmur i do assure ee mrs fiander,0
rosalie looked up gratefully the young man certainly meant well and this information was gratifying she felt a little thrill of melancholy pleasure at the thought of the universal esteem and respect in which her poor elias had been held but meeting the hard expressionless gaze of mr burges tight little eyes the appreciative compliment died upon her lips,0
so now resumed the visitor diving for his hat and carefully tucking away the handkerchief in its liningnow mrs fiander having spoken for myself and for my fellowtownsmen and having assured myself that you are no worse in health than might have been expected under these extraneous circumstances i will withdraw,0
he rose ducked his head extended his hand and solemnly pumped rosalies up and down for about two minutes finally backing to the door,0
as he let himself out he almost fell over another caller who was at that moment raising his hand to the knocker this was a dapper gentleman of about his own age with an alert and sprightly air and a goodhumoured sharpfeatured face,0
rosalie just standing within the halfopen parlourdoor caught sight of the newcomer and wondered who he might be in a moment he had set her doubts at rest,0
goodday maam he remarked advancing cheerily with outstretched hand i must introduce myself i see im not so well known to you as you are to me my name is crosssamuel crossand i am one of mr robinsons clerks robinson and bradbury solicitors you knowthats who i am i just called round toto make a few remarks with regard to certain business matters in the hands of our firm,0
wont you sit down said rosalie hastily taking possession of her husbands chair it should not if she could help it again be desecrated that day she pointed out a small one but mr samuel cross without noticing the intimation stepped quickly forward and seated himself opposite to the widow in the chair she had just vacatedisaac sharpes chair rosalie contemplated him with knitted brows since mr sharpe that trusted friend had not thought fit to occupy his customary place himself that afternoon she felt ill pleased at the intrusion of this presumptuous stranger,0
what a callow little shrimp of a man it was to be sure and how unlike with his spare form and small narrow facea face which she mentally compared to that of a weaselto the large bland personality of isaac,0
a matter of business she said drily i am surprised that mr robinson should send you on sunday,0
oh this is quite an informal visit mrs fiander not at all official i came of my own accordi may say in my private capacity this here is nt a sixandeightpenny affair he he,0
no seeing mrs fiander that you are left so peculiarly lonely and desolate i just thought to myself that it would be only kind to call in in passing and mention that your business matters mrs fiander are in a most satisfactory position i have frequently heard our firm remark that they seldom had to deal with affairs more satisfactory and straightforward,0
my husband had a very clear head for business said mrs fiander i always found that,0
t is nt that alone rejoined the young man it is if i may be permitted to express an opinion the very satisfactory manner in which he has disposed of his property on which i feel bound to congratulate you i called round private as i say jist to let you know as all was most satisfactory,0
thank you i had no doubt about it said rosalie surveying her visitor with increasing disfavour as he leered at her from the depth of isaacs capacious chair,0
ladies he pursued with an ingratiating wriggleladies is apt to be easily alarmed when legal matters is under discussion the very terms which come so natural to us are apt to frighten them lor bless you i dessay when mr robinson do talk about testamentary dispositions and such like it makes you feel quite nervous but t is only the sound of the words as is strange the thing itself meaning the testamentary dispositions of the late lamented mr fiander is i do assure you most satisfactory what with the freehold property meanin the farm and the money invested in such good and safe securitiesyou may be sure that they are good and safe mrs fiander for i may ventur to tell you in confidence that the late lamented used to consult our firm with regard to his investmentsi have pleasure in assuring you that very few ladies find theirselves in so satisfactory a position as you do find yourself today i jist dropped in unofficial like to let you know this for as i said to myself it may be a satisfaction to pore mrs fiander to know her circumstances and to understand that desolate as she may be left there is some compensations and that moreover she has been left absolutely free and independent the late lamented not having hampered her by no conditions whatever,0
here mr cross who had been leaning forward in his chair so that his face with its narrow jaws and its little twinkling eyes had been a good deal below the level of the slightly disdainful countenance of his hostess now slowly straightened himself clapped an exultant hand on either knee and brought the jaws aforesaid together with a snap,0
mrs fiander could not help contrasting him once more with the friend who should by right be sitting opposite to her how far more welcome would have been the sight of the goodtempered rubicund visage the placid portly form even the contented amicable taciturnity which mr sharpe usually maintained during the greater part of his visits would have been far more to her mind than this loquacity which somehow seemed unpleasantly near familiarity still it was unreasonable to take a dislike to the poor young man merely because he looked like a weasel and was disposed to be a little overfriendly no doubt his intention was kind,0
she thanked him therefore with somewhat forced politeness but could not repress a little forward movement in her chair which a sensitive person would have recognized as a token of dismissal mr cross was not however of this calibre and prolonged his visit until his hostesss patience fairly wore out she rose at last glancing at the clock and observing that she thought it was time to get ready for evening church,0
i will have the pleasure of escorting you announced samuel promptly and cheerfully,0
on second thoughts im too tired she said but i will not allow you to delay any longer mr crossyou will certainly be late as it is,0
he had no course but to withdraw then which he did unwillingly enough after tenderly pressing the widows hand and assuring her quite superfluously that she might depend on him to look after her interests in every way in his power,0
rosalie was disconsolately polishing the hand which had received this undesired token of interest when the door creaked slowly open and a tall gaunt elderly female clad in rusty black and wearing somewhat on the back of her head a flat black bonnet with the strings untied entered the room this was mrs greene a personage generally to be met with in this neighbourhood in households whose number had recently been either increased or diminished she was equally at home as she once remarked with babies and with corpses and she filled up the intervals by charing her appearance was so genteel and her manner of fulfilling her various duties so elegant that the clergymans daughter had once remarked that she was wonderfully refined for a charwoman the appellation had stuck to her and she was commonly known as the refined charwoman among such of the gentry as occasionally employed her in that capacity,0
she had come to littlecomb farm to lay out poor elias fiander and she was remaining on as chief factotum and comforter for it was nt to be supposed that the poor young widow ud be eqal to lookin after the maidsmuch less to turn her thoughts to doin for herself she now advanced slowly to the table and after heaving a deep sigh proceeded to lay the cloth rosalie knew that she was burning to enter into conversation but was too much dispirited to encourage her but byandby after a preliminary cough mrs greene remarked in a lugubrious tone,0
thats a lovely cap mum everybody was asayin that you did look charmin in your weeds ay that was what they said she do look charmingthat was the very thing they said t is a comfort too says they to see how nice she do mourn for mr fiander they was all apassing the remark one to the other about it mumadmirable they said it was,0
nonsense cried rosalie wrathfully but with a little quaver in her voice it would be very strange i think if i did not grieve for such a good husband i wish people would nt talk about me she added petulantly,0
talk ejaculated mrs greene dismally ah they will talk mum you may depend on it theyll alays talk and perticlarly about a young widow lord how they did go on about me when poor greene died they did nt leave so much as my furnitur alone whether i could afford to keep it or whether id be for ridden house and goin into lodgins and whether id put the children in an orphanage and get married againit was enough to drive a body silly the way they did go on,0
disgusting cried rosalie now faintly interested the idea of talking of a second marriage when your poor husband was only just dead,0
why that be the first thing theyd talk on with a kind of dismal triumphmore perticlar if a woman be young and goodlookin in your own case mum i do assure ye they be all apickin out your second ah thats what they be adoin but as they all picks different men they dont so very well agree,0
mrs greene ejaculated her mistress indignantly wheeling round in her chair what do you mean how dare you come and repeat such things to meits positively indecent,0
that be the very remark as i did pass myself to the men yesterday retorted mrs greene pausing to contemplate mrs fiander with her hands upon her hips the very thing t is most onbecomin says i to be settin yourselves up to pry into the affairs o your betters missus says i be athinkin of nothing but her mournin so far and when she do make her chice says i shell please herself and pick out him as is most suitable them was my words mum,0
well cried rosalie rising to her feet impetuously i wonder you dare to own them to me mrs greene i think that considering you are a widow yourself you ought to know better than to accuse another woman of such faithlessness if you think i could ever ever forget my good kind husband you are much mistaken,0
why should i marry again any more than you cried rosalie with angry tears starting to her eyes,0
well mum the cases be very different nobody never axed it was nt very likely as they should considering i had six children and only my own labour to keep em as for you mum nobody could nt think it at all strange if you was to get married againconsiderin everything you know your station in life continued mrs greene delicately and your not bein blessed with no children and your fortun and your oncommon looksit ud be very strange if there was nt amany acoming coortin yeand you may depend upon it they will she cried with conviction and seein how young you be mum and how lonesome like i should say it be amost your dooty to take a second,0
now listen to me mrs greene said rosalie very emphatically i wish to put an end to this foolish gossip at once you can tell everybody that you hear talking about the matter that i never intend to marry again neverdo you hear me,0
yes mum returned mrs greene with every feature and line of her countenance expressing disbelief i hear praps i better begin by lettin them two chaps know what called here today i do low theyll be disappinted,0
i wish you would nt talk such nonsense mrs greene cried rosalie almost pettishly though the colour rushed over her face and a startled expression showed itself for a moment in her heavy eyes go away i dont want to be worried any more remember what i have said thats all,0
nothing coming nothing going landrail craking one cock crowing few things moving up and down all things drowsy,0
rosalie passed a very unquiet night and woke from a troubled sleep shortly after dawn the deadweight of grief ever present to her since her bereavement was now as she dimly felt supplemented by something elsesomething irritating something unpleasant as her scattered faculties returned to her she gradually recognised that this state of feeling was produced by several small causes the two visits which she had received yesterday and which she had supposed to proceed from mere officious goodwill had as she now acknowledged been prompted in all probability by aspirations as unjustifiable as they were unseemly her subsequent interview with mrs greene had disagreeably enlightened her on this point and had also made her aware of the kind of gossip to which she must expect to be subjected thenall through that long lonely heavy day isaac sharpe had not once put in an appearance he her husbands faithful friend the only real friend whom she herself acknowledged had not thought fit to look in for so much as five minutes to cheer her in her desolation as she thought of these things hot tears welled afresh to her eyes oh how desolate she was no one really cared for her and what was almost worse no one seemed to believe in the sincerity of her affliction,0
as she lay tossing uneasily on her pillow and as the light grew and brightened and the birds jubilant songs mingled with the distant lowing of cows a new sense of disquietude came to her proceeding from a different and very tangible cause it was broad daymonday morninga morning of exceptional importance at the farmand no human being seemed yet to be afoot reaching up her hand to the oldfashioned watchpocket which hung in the centre of the bed she took down eliass heavy silver repeater and pressed the spring ting ting ting ting ting five oclock sitting up she sent the two cases flying open and gazed almost incredulously at the dial beneath ten minutes past fiveno less she sprang out of bed and flung open her door,0
jane susan what are you about t is past five oclock and churning morning how did you come to oversleep yourselves like that,0
there was a muffled murmur a thud upon the floor a pat pat of bare feet across the room above and a door overhead opened,0
was i calling i should think i was calling have you forgotten what morning it is,0
nay missus that i havent lord no t was this day seennight as poor master was buried dear yes so t was,0
a lump rose in rosalies throat but she steadied her voice and said coldly,0
i am not talking of that it is churning morning as you know very well you should have been up and about an hour ago make as much haste as you can now and come down,0
she closed the door with just sufficient noise to indicate the condition of her feelings and hastened across the room to the open window drawing the curtains apart she looked out a glorious summers day not a cloud upon the pearlyblue expanse of sky the leaves stirring gently in a fresh breezea breeze laden with all the exquisite spicy scents of morning the fragrance of dewy grasses of sunkissed trees of newlyawakened flowers the monthly rosetree climbing round her mullioned window thrust its delicate clusters of bloom almost into rosalies face but she pushed it impatiently aside her eyes cast a keen glance on the homely scene beyond above the timeworn roofs of the farmbuildings where the green of the moss and the mellow red and yellow of the tiles were alike transfigured by this mystic glow she could see last years ricks shouldering each other their regular outlines defined as it were with a pencil of fire the great meadow beyond which sloped downwards till it reached the churchyard wall a quarter of a mile away broke into light ripples tawny and russet as the breeze swept over it,0
surely these were sights to gladden a young hearteven a heart that had been sorrowingyet the expression of rosalies eyes grew more and more discontented and displeased and a frown gathered on her brow,0
the fowl were flocking impatiently about the gate of the great barnyard yonder on the further side from beneath the tiled roof of the line of pigsties she could hear loud vociferations turning her eyes towards the stablebuildings which ran at right angles to them she could see that the doors were fast closed and could hear the rattling of chains and stamping of heavy hoofs within the church meadow ought to have been cut todaythe grass was overripe as it was men and horses should have been at work since three oclock no figures appeared even in the neighbourhood of the barn and looking beyond to the barton proper she could see that it was empty no wonder that the lowing of the cows had sounded distant in her ears they were still in their pasture by the river poor creatures crowding round the gate no doubt as the fowl were doing close at hand all clamouring alike for the attention which was evidently withheld from them what was everyone about why had not the men come to their work as usual,0
she performed her toilet hastily and somewhat perfunctorily and when at last a sleepylooking redhaired man came slouching up the lane which led to the farm he was surprised to see a figure in rustling print and broadbrimmed chip hat standing in the midst of a bevy of cocks and hens scattering handfuls of grain with wide impetuous sweeps of a round vigorous arm,0
but the face which was flashed upon him was not the rosy and somewhat vacant one of susan but belonged to no less a person than missus herself,0
whats the hurry job she repeated severely i should like to know why there is nt a little more hurry what has become of all the men has anybody gone to fetch the cows what is everyone about i say,0
job tilted his hat a little sideways on his red locks the better to scratch his head and gazed at his mistress with a puzzled and somewhat scandalised expression,0
ye must expect things to be a bit onreglar for a bit mum he remarked seein the loss weve had and us all bein so upset like about poor master we hant agot the eart to go about our work as if nothin had happened it baint to be looked for nay now he continued mildly an we did nt look to find yerself agoin about this waywe did nt sure it scarce seems naitral if i may make so bold as to say so it do seemhere job fixed an expostulatory glance on the angry young face that was confronting himit d seem scarce right mum,0
job hunt returned his mistress haughtily you are not called upon to make remarks upon my actions but i will tell you so much it is my duty to see that the work in this place is properly done and i intend that it shall be properly done go and call the other men at once tell them if they are ever again so disgracefully late they shall all be fined call them quickly she added with an imperative tap of the foot and then go and fetch the cows,0
as she turned to reenter the house she caught sight of susan who was evidently exchanging astonished and depreciatory grimaces with job while mrs greene in the background was raising hands and eyes to heaven,0
come get to work she cried sharply skim the cream susan and you jane get the churn ready well mrs greene what are you staring at have you never seen me work before that the fact of my turning up my sleeves need astonish you so much i suppose you can find something to do about the house give me that other skimmer jane,0
ho dear yes mum i can find a plenty to do about this here house i wur but alookin at you mum because it do really seem amost too much for flesh an blood to be atakin on itself as you be atakin on yourself now mum dear yes but its to be hoped as ye wont overtax your constitootion mrs fiander,0
go and clean the kitchen grate said rosalie beginning to skim with great rapidity and decision and see that you blacklead it properly,0
ho yes mum ill blacklead it returned the elder matron without however attempting to move from the spot where she stood and continuing to fix her eyes mournfully on her mistressill blacklead it right enough she repeated with a kind of groan after a pause during which she had meditatively polished first one skinny bare arm and then the other with a not overclean apron,0
well why in heavens name dont you go then cried rosalie impatiently for she felt mrs greenes sorrowfully disapproving gaze right at the back of her head,0
i be going mum i be going if i mid take the liberty of remindin you mumt is your hat as youve agot on your head,0
well mrs fiander returned the charwoman with an insinuating smile would nt you like me to run upstairs wi it now and fetch you down your cap,0
no replied her mistress very shortly if i had wished for it i should have sent for it you need not be so officious the strings would get in my way while i worked she added a little inconsequently she felt she was lowering herself by making this explanation yet she could not bear that even mrs greene and the two maids should think her wanting in respect to eliass memory,0
mrs greene withdrew murmuring under her breath that it was to be oped as nobody would nt chance t look in that morning which was not indeed very likely the hands of the oldfashioned clock in the kitchen beyond just pointing to the quarterpast six,0
for some minutes nothing was heard but the clinking of the skimmers against the sides of the vats as the rich cream clotted and crinkled and thick was removed therefrom the scene was a pretty one indeed such a dairy on such a summers morning must always hold a charm and a picturesqueness of its own and now that the angular presence of mrs greene was removed there was absolutely no discordant element in this cool harmony the dairy itself was a wide pleasant room its buff walls and redflagged floor throwing out the exquisite tints of the vast tracts of cream each marked off by its own barrier of glancing tin and varying in tone from the deep yellow of that portion destined for the mornings churning to the warm white of the foaming pailfuls which job poured from time to time somewhat sulkily into the vat nearest the door then there was the green of the gently swaying boughs without seen through windows and open door the brilliant patch of sunlight creeping over the uneven threshold the glint of blue sky between sunlit green and sunlit stone the brave array of glittering cans on the topmost shelf added their own share of brightness the great earthenware crocks and pans some the very colour of the cream itself some ruddy in tone some of a deep rich brown lent also valuable aid then there were tall white jars containing lard carefullypacked baskets and smooth wooden vessels piled high with eggs little squares of filmy gauze hung out on lines in readiness for the golden rolls of butter which they were soon to enfold the figures of the girls themselvesfor the mistress of littlecomb farm was no more than a girl in yearsgave the necessary and very delightful touch of human interest susan and jane in cotton dresses and large aprons so immaculate that the mere sight of them was sufficient to recall that it was the first day of the week were not without a certain rustic charm of their own as for rosalie standing in the foreground with her sleeves rolled up on her white arms her print dress fitting so closely to her beautiful form the hair hastily rolled up escaping into such exquisite curls and tendrils round brow and ear and shapely neckrosalie was as ever what her admiring old elias had once called herthe leading article,0
when the churn was fairly at work the skimmilk duly meted out to the pigs and the long procession of dairy cows were sauntering back to their pasture under the guardianship of job and the three chaps who had till then been busily milking rosalie removed her hat and sat down to breakfast,0
the flush of annoyance still lingered on her face and while she ate her glance wandered through the window to the premises without she could hear robert cross and james bundy leisurely leading out the horses inducing them with many objurgations to stand while they were being harnessed to the rattling creaking mower how slow they were they should have been in the field hours ago and yet they slouched about as though the beautiful golden morning were not already half over now at last they were startingno here was james coming back for something they had forgotten rising hastily from her chair she leaned out of the open window tapping impatiently on the pane what are you about bundy why on earth dont you try and make a little more haste,0
mum gasped bundy turning round a vacant weatherbeaten countenance adorned with the smallest fraction of a nose which it was possible for the face of man to possess,0
i say why dont you make more haste when you have lost so much time already,0
i be making so much haste as ever i can responded james much aggrieved i be just acomin to fetch the ilecan t would nt be no use to get to work without the ilecan,0
why did nt you think about the oilcan while cross was harnessing the horses t is nearly eight oclockyou have lost half your mornings work,0
bundy looked up at the sky then still in an aggrieved manner at his mistress,0
we was all so upset he was beginning when she interrupted him fiercely,0
dont let me hear another word about your being upset if i can attend to my business you can attend to yours i should think t is but an excuse for disgraceful laziness,0
we was upset asserted bundy with much dignity and as for bein behind if it comes to that we can keep on workin a bit later this aternoon,0
you must certainly work later this afternoon but how long will this fine weather last think you besides you know as well as i do that it is much better for the horses to work in the early morning there get started now and try to make up for lost time,0
she returned to her breakfast and james rejoined his companion at a slightly accelerated pace but byandby her attention was caught by the sound of voices apparently in placid conversation back to the window again flew she the village carpenter who was supposed to be repairing the yardgate had just arrived and was leaning negligently against one of the posts while abel hunt jobs brother a large bucket of pigfood in either hand was leisurely talking to him,0
i will give them a few minutes said rosalie to herself after all i must nt be too hard on them,0
once more she went back to the table finished her egg and drank her second cup of tea the trickle of talk meanwhile continuing without ceasing,0
pushing back her chair she returned to the window impatiently the carpenter had remained in the same attitude without even unfastening his bag of tools abel had set down his pails and propped himself up against the other gatepost the pigs were wildly protesting in the background,0
rosalie recrossed the room hastily and went to the door,0
do you intend to gossip here all day she inquired with flashing eyes,0
we was jest atalkin about the melancolly event explained the carpenter,0
you will oblige me said rosalie by keeping to your work abel take those pails across to the sties at once remember i will have no more dawdling,0
abel took up his pails and the carpenter unfastened his tools the expression of both faces alike shocked wounded and astonished,0
if this goes on murmured rosalie to herself i shall not only break my heart but go out of my mind oh elias you were clever as well as kindeverything seemed to go by clockwork when you were hereoh why did you leave me,0
an o worken days oh he do wear such a funny roun hatyou mid knowt wi a brim all astrout roun his hair an his glissenn eyes down belowt an a coat wi broad skirts that do vlee in the wind ov his walk round his knee,0
all the forenoon was passed in buttermaking and in the afternoon rosalie betook herself to the mead to superintend the operations of james and robert it was not until after tea that she had leisure to change her dress and make her way by the wellknown little footpath that skirted the cornfields and wound across the downs to isaac sharpes farm,0
she found that worthy standing contemplatively in the middle of his yard there had been sheepshearing that day and the master had worked as hard as any of the men now however the naked ungainlylooking ewes had returned to their pasture the newlytaken fleeces lay neatly piled up in a corner of the barn and isaac was at liberty to straighten his weary back relax his muscles and smoke the pipe of peace,0
tall massive and imposing was this figure of his ever at its best in the smockfrock and serviceable corduroys and leggings of weekday wear his wideawake turned up at the back and projecting in front in the orthodox shovel form was decidedly more becoming than the sunday beaver he started as the yardgate creaked upon its hinges and rosalies blackrobed figure passed through,0
why mrs fiander he cried hastening towards her be this you im glad to see ye is there anything i can do for ee,0
rosalie could hardly have defined the motive which prompted her visit her desolate heart felt the need of sympathy in this strange new life of hers she yearned to find herself once more if but for a moment in touch with the past no mr sharpe she said with a little gasp i dont think theres anything you can do for me i only came because iioh mr sharpe everything is going wrong,0
isaac sharpe took out his pipe and opened his eyes very wide,0
everythings the matter returned the widow in a shaking voice oh isaac i cant get on without elias,0
cant ee now my dear returned isaac blinking very hard well im sure t is natral,0
rosalie gave a little sob and the farmer stretching out a large brown hand patted her arm soothingly,0
dont ee take on though he said nay now dont ee take on my dear cryin never did nobody no good,0
im so lonely went on the girl brokenly i miss him at every turn,0
yed be like to do that responded sharpe judicially dear yesyed be like to do that,0
everything is at sixes and sevens she pursued plaintively the men think they can do just as they like it was eight oclock before they began their mowing this morning,0
well i never ejaculated isaac eight oclock what be the world comin to,0
the very maids wont get up continued rosalie this was churning morning and it was after five before anybody moved none of the men came near the place until six the cows were left in the pasture none of the beasts were fed,0
shockin shockin commented the farmer dear heart alive i never heard o sich doins,0
when i speak to them cried rosalie her voice rising with the recollection of her wrongs they turn round and tell me they are all too much upset to think of work,0
do they now in tones of deep disgust well an thats a pretty story,0
yes and you know mr sharpe t is the last thing elias would have wishedthat the work should be neglected and everything allowed to go wrong like this yet they seem to think me heartless for expecting things to go on as before and the worst of it all ishere poor rosalie began to weep hystericallythey dont any of them believe that i am sorry for elias and they think im going to marry again and andtwo hateful odious impudent young men have already come to court me,0
her sobs wellnigh choked her as she made this last announcement and isaac full of concern fell to patting her arm again,0
dont ee now my dear dont ee well t is very annoyin for ee im sure there dont ee cry so well well to think ont started coortin aready have they well they mid ha waited a bit but come in a minute do ee mrs fiander and sit ee down dear heart alive dear heart alive poor elias ud be terrible upset if he were to see ye agivin way like this,0
he half persuaded half propelled the still weeping widow across the yard and into his kitchen where sitting down near the table and covering her face with her hands under the heavy crape veil she continued to sob until her host was nearly distracted,0
here my dear take a sup o this t will do ye good,0
rosalie threw back her veil and took the glass which he offered her raising it to her lips she found that the dark decoction which it contained was excessively strong unusually acid and unspeakably nasty fresh tears not prompted by sorrow this time started to her eyes as she set down the glass,0
thank you mr sharpe she said i am better now i dont think ill finish it it seems very strong,0
ah its that agreed the farmer with some pride sloe wine bithey d call it she do make a quart every year wonderful good for the spasms or sichlike she do get taken that way sometimes in her inards pore old soul an she says a drop o this do alays set her to rights sloe wine ah thats what it be called yed scarce think twere made o nought but the snags what grows in the hedgesjist snags an a trifle o sugar but i do assure ye t is that strong t will sometimes lift the cork out o the bottle now mrs fiander yed best finish it t is a pity to let the good stuff go to waste,0
but as rosalie gratefully but firmly declined the worthy man appeased his thrifty conscience by draining the glass himself,0
well now mrs fiander he resumed as he set it down i be trewly sorry that ye be so vexed an annyed wi the men comin so late but if i may advise ee be a bit stiff wi em dont ee let em fancy they can impose upon ee because ye be a woman,0
i assure you mr sharpe i showed them very plainly that i was vexed this morning i spoke as severely as i could,0
lard my dear them chaps dont care for words more perticlar a womans words bless you theyve all got womenfolks o their own an they be well used to scoldin t is different wi us men when we be angry we can dang here and there and use a bit o language then d ye see said isaac leaning forward confidentially the chaps understand as we be in earnest but t ud be no manner o good your tryin to do that my dear t would nt come natral to ee and they would nt think a bit the better of ee for it nay nay he repeated mournfully they wouldnt think the better of ee,0
a faint smile hovered round rosalies lips but isaac remained quite serious,0
a woman must show by her deeds that she be in earnest he went on after a pause t is the only way my dear deeds and not words for a woman,0
here he paused again shaking his head reflectively it was possible that his thoughts had travelled back to that memorable box in which his erring father had enshrined the riven locks that testified to his own transgressions and the vigorous retaliation of his wife isaacs late mother had certainly been a woman of action,0
thats it my dear repeated sharpe emerging from his reverie yell be forced to turn to deeds next time them chaps comes late jist you up an fine them says you short work desarves short pay bear in mind says you that accordin to the work shall be the wage,0
yes i might try that agreed rosalie but the worst of it is they lose so much time and do their work so badly when they do come,0
then jist make a example o one o themthats your best plan give the worst o them the sack and yell find the others ull settle down likelike lambs said the sheepfarmer bringing out the simile triumphantly,0
thank you very much for your advice mr sharpe ill take it and now she paused a moment blushingwhat would you recommend me to do with regard to my other difficulty how am i to make people understand that i dont mean to marry again,0
well a body ud really think they need nt be so pushin remarked isaac it be downright ondacent for em to be ahangin about ee so soon,0
they have no business to think of it at all mr sharpe interrupted the widow fiercely i shall never never put anyone in my dear eliass place,0
thats very well said my dear returned isaac looking at her with real kindness and emotion t is the proper spirit i myself as you may have heard me say was never one to set up for wedlock well yeve had a husband and a good un an you be in the right ot to be satisfied wi that just as i be satisfied wi havin no wife at all dear heart alive when i were a young chap the maids did use to be castin their eyes at me but i never took no notice and when i grew more staid there was one very perseverin woman i do mindvery perseverin she were ah she come to house here time and again wi one excuse or another and at last so soon as i did see her comin i did use to shut door in her face,0
why thats what i shall do cried rosalie laughing and clapping her handsthats the very thing i shall do thank you for the hint mr sharpe that again you see will be deeds not words,0
isaac looked kindly at the bright face and sparkling eyes and nodded cheerfully,0
i only wish i had thought of it on sunday she went on those two men sat and talked so long that i was wishing them anywhere i expected you on sunday mr sharpe she added in an altered voice while the smile vanished from her face,0
yes i did indeedi thought you would have come if only in memory of old times,0
why to tell the trewth i could nt abear to go nigh the place blurted out the farmer nay nayive been agoin to littlecomb farm sunday after sunday for nigh upon five and twenty year i dont know how you could expect me mrs fiander to go there now as he be gone,0
he wiped his eyes with the sleeve of his smockfrock and at this tribute to eliass memory his widow forgave the gruffness of isaacs tone and almost but not quite the slight to herself,0
she gazed at him for a moment in silence with a quivering lip and he wiped his eyes again and heaved a sigh,0
you do not think of me at all said rosalie at last you dont consider my loneliness or what i feel when i sit there looking at the two empty chairs and thinking of how i used to sit between you and how happy we used to be is nt it worse for me to see his empty place than you you might have comeeven if it did hurt youyou might have come to bring me a word of comfort i think you were very unkind mr sharpe,0
dont ee now my dear stammered isaac almost purple in the face and with his usually keen eyes suffused with tears i do really feel touched to the eart when you look at me so pitiful and say such things god knows id be main glad to comfort you but what can the likes of i do,0
you could let me feel that i had still a friend sobbed rosalie you might come and sit in your old chair and we couldwe could talk about elias,0
thats trew so we could agreed isaac in a choked voice well next sundayif i live so longill not let nothing hinder me ill come my dear i d low i should ha thought of you yesterday but i could nt seem to think o nothing but how lias war nt there,0
well i shall be very glad to see you said rosalie rising and tremulously beginning to pull down her veil and i am very grateful for your kindness perhaps she added hesitatingly you might be able to look in one day during the week,0
nay returned the farmer nay mrs fiander not before sunday i be very busy toweekwe be shearin d ye see and theres the big mead to be cut naynot before sunday,0
oh very well she responded a little stiffly and she went out of the house and across the yard without speaking again except to say goodbye at the gate,0
the downs were now all bathed with the light of the sinking sun and the topmost branches of the hedges which bordered the cornfields seemed turned to gold while the banks beneath had begun already to assume the deeper tint that spoke of gathering dewdew that the morning light would turn to a very sheet of silver but rosalie could only see the beauties of the world without through a mist of crape and tears,0
i have not a friend in the world she said to herself not one isaac would nt even take the trouble to walk a quarter of a mile to see how i was getting on after following his advice he is only coming on sunday as a sort of duty not because he wants to well never mind i will show him and everyone that i can look after myself i want nobodys pretended pity since nobody really cares,0
and she held up her head beneath its heavy veil and went on her way with a stately carriage and a firm step,0
he drowd hizzelf about an tevd an blowd lik any uptied calf an mutterd out sich dreats an wrung his vist up sich a size,0
on the next morning when the men came slowly sauntering to their work they were surprised to see mrs fiander clad this time not in homely print but in ceremonious black standing by her own door with a severe expression of countenance she held a notebook in her hand and as each arrived she jotted down some memorandum therein when the last straggler had appeared upon the scene she summoned the entire band before her,0
men she said speaking calmly and very distinctly since you seem to pay no attention to what i say i must show you that i am not to be trifled with i shall fine every one of you this morning for being late i shall continue to fine you each morning that you are late and i shall deduct from your pay a certain amount for every hour that you wilfully waste in fact for the future your wage shall be in exact proportion to the work you do,0
the men stared gaped and looked sullenly first at one another and then at their mistress,0
job hunt his redbearded face even more glowing than usual answered in surly tones for himself and comrades,0
well then ill make it clear to you rang out the brisk young voice you are paid for the work you do during certain hours and if you dont come here punctually or if you waste any of those hours i shall deduct from your weekly wage the value of the lost timei shant pay you in fact for work you dont do,0
nay now responded job rolling his head from side to side and assuming a bullying air i dont hold wi these here reglations us dont want no new rules do us mates,0
nay that we dont came the answer in a chorus of growls,0
whether you want them or not i mean to keep to them returned rosalie that will do you can all go to work now,0
she turned and went into the house her heart was beating very fast and she was rather white about the lips but she had borne herself bravely and no one would have guessed the difficulty she had found in nerving herself to take this stand,0
she could hear the mens voices murmuring together discontentedly but byandby the sound of heavy slouching steps moving away in different directions warned her that the group had dispersed,0
it being the morning for cheesemaking she presently went upstairs to change her imposing black robe for her working dress and chancing as she came downstairs to look out of the window she observed that job hunt was standing arms akimbo by the pigsties in close conversation with his brother now job should at that moment have been far on his way to the pasture abel ought to have been feeding the pigs this was palpable defiance,0
deeds not words said rosalie to herself they think i am merely threateningi must show them i am in earnest,0
it is now halfpast five she remarked you job are two hours and a half late you abel an hour i have made a note of the time moreover if i find that you continue to disobey me i shall not keep you in my service,0
job made an indescribable sound between a snort and a groan and slowly walked away abel however continued to stare darkly at his mistress without changing his position,0
as rosalie now thoroughly incensed was about to pour out upon him the vials of her wrath she suddenly perceivedthe fact being unmistakably impressed upon herthat the pigsties near which she stood were in a most disgraceful condition,0
abel she said when were these sties cleaned out not i am sure on saturday,0
i weremortal busy o saturday returned abel in sepulchral tones,0
why were you more busy last saturday than on any other saturday,0
abel shuffled from one foot to the other and repeated sulkily that he had been mortal busy,0
you must clean them as soon as ever you have fed the pigs said rosalie sharply t is enough to bring fever to the place to have them in this state,0
do not attempt to answer me back like that she cried it must be very bad for the poor animals themselves get to work without a moments delay,0
saturday is the day growled the man imblowed if i clean em out afore saturday,0
mind what you are about said his mistress sternly uplifting a warning forefinger i will not put up with impertinence or disobedience,0
saturday is the day shouted abel and the shuffling movement became so violent and rapid that he actually seemed to dance,0
this will never do said rosalie i see i must make a change at once abel hunt i give you notice to leave on saturday week,0
one change be enough for me widow fiander retorted abel uplifting his voice as though his mistress stood a hundred yards away from him instead of barely two,0
t is your own fault she cried passionately if you behave in this way i must make an example of you unless you do as i tell you you must go,0
im danged if i do clean the pigs out afore saturday shrieked abel and he threw his hat upon the ground waved his arms and stamped about like a maniac i dont want no danged womenfolk to come aorderin o me and here abel relieved his feelings by what isaac sharpe would delicately call a bit o language,0
clean your pigs yourself widow fiander one change be enough for me notice me so much as ever ye like ill not clean them pigs out afore saturday,0
then came a little more language and so on da capo,0
never had such an experience fallen to rosalies lot before neither her kind old grandfather nor her doting husband had ever given her a rough word while they lived her subordinates had invariably obeyed her orders with alacrity and treated her personally with respect the sound of abels strident tones the sight of his inflamed face above all the words he used and the insolence of his manner positively frightened her she turned pale trembledthen making a valiant effort to stand her ground threw out her hand as though to command silence but as abel continued to dance and rave sheer physical terror overcame her and she suddenly turned and fled her heart thumping violently against her ribs the tearsnever very far off during these first days of her bereavementspringing to her eyes,0
she rushed upstairs to her room and flung herself across the bed burying her face in the pillow in an agony of humiliation,0
what a fool i am what a miserable fool to be afraid of that wretched booby how can i ever hope to rule these people if i show the white feather at the outset now of course they will think that theyve only got to bully me and i shall at once give in oh fool fool to give way to silly womanish fears at such a moment oh oh how shall i ever look them in the face,0
she continued to roll her head on the pillow for some moments her cheeks had now become burning and her heart still beat fast no longer with terror but with anger byandby she sat up pushed back her hair and shook out the folds of her dress,0
after all t is never too late to mend she said to herself,0
she went downstairs and into the dairy directing her maids somewhat sharply and setting about her own work with flushed cheeks and a serious face in course of time her agitation subsided and after her solitary breakfast she was quite herself again,0
at noon as she passed through the kitchen to the parlour she chanced to glance through the open door and observed that the men had gathered together in the yard and were eagerly talking instead of making their way homewards or retiring to the barn to eat their dinners she feigned to pay no attention to them however and walked on to her own quarters,0
presently she became aware that the whole body was advancing towards the house and a moment later susan thrust in her round face at the door,0
please mum the men be wishin to speak a few words with ee,0
very well said rosalie i will go out to them,0
on reaching the threshold of the outer door she paused looking round on the group and waiting for them to take the initiative job was as before the first to speak,0
i be come to tell ee mrs fiander as i wish to notice ye for saturday week these here changes baint to my likin and the mistress baint to my likin so yell please to suit yourself by that time mum,0
he spoke gruffly and eyed her impertinently but this time she did not flinch,0
very well job she said i have no doubt i shall be able to do so without any difficulty,0
abel was the next to advance but rosalie waved him aside,0
as it has already been settled that you are to leave she remarked you can have nothing to say to me step back now who comes next,0
james bundy it seemed came next he approached a little hesitatingly looking hard at his mistress,0
james bundy stepped back and robert cross stepped forward smiling obsequiously,0
im sure mum it do go agen me terrible to make sich a break as this here but still d ye see we cant nohow put up with,0
you need not take the trouble to explainyou wish to leave on saturday week with the others i suppose,0
that will do said rosalie now sam belbin you wish to leave too,0
sam belbin made a step forward and glanced round appealingly,0
by this time his companions were looking very blank the sudden assault by which they had expected to frighten their mistress into capitulation had apparently failed their respective attitudes had changed she was calm and unmoved and they were beginning to be seriously uneasy good places and regular pay were not to be picked up every day in that part of the world,0
well sam said rosalie kindly as though to help him out,0
sam was the chief of the three dairy chaps a goodlooking young fellow of about fourandtwenty with a dark goodhumoured countenance and a certain jaunty air as he now advanced a smile flashed suddenly over his face his white teeth gleaming out pleasantly,0
well sam what have you got to say the usual thing i suppose,0
no mumnot at all mum iwish to say as i havent got no fault to find at all mum ill come in better time tomorrow morn an yell not have to speak to me agen mum,0
very good said rosalie in a different tone at this unexpected speech a lump came in her throat but she choked it down,0
have the others got anything to say she inquired because if so i hope they will make haste and say it my dinner will be getting cold,0
the men who had not hitherto spoken looked at each other uncertainly their glances finally resting on the beaming countenance of sam belbin after all had he not chosen the better part,0
i do agree with he said one under his breath and then another byandby all remarked aloud somewhat falteringly that they just thought they would mention their wish to give more satisfaction in the future,0
job and his followers scowled at these renegades but their mistress rewarded them with a gracious smile,0
very well said she remarked thats the proper spirit do your duty by me and you will find me ready to do mine by you,0
the day was hers as she felt when she returned in triumph to her dinner,0
isaac sharpe happened to be strolling through the village that evening when he was accosted by mrs belbin who was standing as was her custom at this hour arms akimbo on her doorstep,0
there be a great upset up at fianders baint there sir,0
isaac brought his slow ruminative gaze to bear on her,0
why what upset do ye mean mrs belbin things be like to be upset now that the masters gone to the new house but i hope as your son an the rest of em be giving the widow so little trouble as ever they can,0
i dunno about that sir my sam he do tell i as there was a regular blowup this mornin i d low as my son he did behave so well as ever he could says he to mrs fiander mum he says i have nt no fault to find wi you at all and ill do my hendeavours to gie ye satisfaction that were what he did saymy son sam did but there was others as accordin to all accounts went on most scandalious,0
here mrs belbin rolled up her eyes and wagged her head significantly,0
ah put in mrs paddock hastening to cross the road and join in the conversation it did give me sich a turn when i heard on it that i did sit down on the table t were a good job as i did else i should ha fell down sich doins the whole lot of emaye every single one as works for hermarchin up to give her notice t was enough to frighten a pore lone woman out of her wits,0
i have nt heard a word of this cried isaac emphatically the men gave her notice d ye say,0
all except my sam put in mrs belbin proudly ees they all did go up in a lump so to speak and noticed her one arter the other till it come to my sams turn an then he up an says mrs fiander mum says he i have nt got no fault to find wi ye and a few more when they heard that heartened theirselves up and follered his example,0
t was very well done o your sam said mrs paddock in a complimentary tone but as for them otherswhy they do say as abel hunt were adancin an aswearin like a madman i want no orderin from danged womenfolk says he just so bold as if the missus was his wife and job he did shout at her so rough and speak so impident t was really shockin,0
i must go up and see her said sharpe much perturbed im sure i dont know whatevers come to folks these times as to them huntsill gie them a bit o my mind they should be ashamed o theirselves to treat a pore young creature so disrespectful they do think i sppose as mrs fiander has nt got nobody to purtect her and they can serve her so bad as they like but them as was friends to her husband is friends to her pore young thing well i be glad your son did do his duty by her anyways mrs belbin my father amighty these be times,0
he walked away at an accelerated pace the women looking after him,0
he did speak so feelin did nt he commented mrs paddock pore young creature says he d ye mind an pore young thing master be a very feelin man,0
ah agreed mrs belbin an he did say as he were glad my sam did do his duty ah he be a good man master be but i would nt like so very much to be abel hunt jist nownay nor job neither,0
the mistress of littlecomb farm had no cause to complain of the unpunctuality of any of her workpeople on the following morning each man appeared at the very moment he was supposed to appear the maids were up betimes and the business of the day progressed with far greater speed than usual,0
at dinnertime she again observed a group of men in the yard smaller in number however than on the preceding day and talking with dismal countenances and hesitating tones susan came presently to announce as before that some of the men wished to speak to her,0
rosalie went out and discovered a detachment of four awaiting her two with plaintive wobegone faces the others in a state of surly depression,0
missus stammered james bundy we be acomeme and these here chapsbe acome to pologise and to say as we hopes ye wont bear no malice and as yell overlook what has passed well undertake to give satisfaction from this time forard,0
t is a pity you did not say that yesterday james said rosalie severely,0
if yed please to overlook it mum resumed james falteringly we was so to speak took by surprise wi the new rules and we was persuadedhere he darted a reproachful glance at joeive got a long family mum he added tearfully and my wifeshe be near her time wi the eleventh,0
well james you have been foolish but i do not altogether think it was your fault i will make no definite promise but i will see how you go on between this and saturday week,0
i be to go on saturday week ejaculated james whose wits were none of the keenest and who was more impressed by the severity of the tone than by rosalies actual words,0
no no you foolish fellow come i will give you another chance but mind you behave very well,0
mine be a very long family too he began having evidently remarked the happy results which had ensued from bundys plea rosalie stopped him,0
well i will give you another chance cross she said next time think twice before you follow a bad leader as for you abel hunt she said turning sternly to that gentleman i am at a loss to know what you can have to sayin fact i have no wish to hear it whatever it may be you must go no apology can atone for your insolence yesterday,0
and how be you goin to manage about them pigs inquired abel plaintively,0
mr sharpe was aspeakin to me yesterday put in job very humbly for his courage was fast oozing away an he did say twould be terrible illconvenient for ee to have so many chaps aleavin together an so me an my brother agreed as wed ax to stop on,0
i can do very well without you retorted mrs fiander tartly no job you have behaved too badly you have been the ringleader of this disgraceful businessyou must certainly go,0
yes saturday weekyou and abel how abel can suppose i could possibly keep him after such conduct i cant imagine i certainly will not,0
mr sharpe did sayjob was beginning now almost in tears when she interrupted him relentlessly,0
never mind what mr sharpe said i have quite made up my mind as to what i shall do,0
she was thoroughly in earnest and the men knew it they fell back ruefully and their young mistress returned to the house carrying her head very high and setting her face sternly,0
when her work was over that afternoon she set out with a businesslike air on what seemed to be a tour of inspection first walking briskly along the rows of pigsties the condition of which had on the day before given rise to so much controversy all was now as it should be abel sam and one or two of the other subordinates having devoted their attention to them at early dawn here were pigs of every age and degree from the venerable matron to the spry young porker just beginning to devote himself to the serious business of lifenamely growing fat seventytwo in all and most of them doomed to destruction within a few months that was the part of the economy of farming which rosalie most disliked it was the blot on the otherwise poetical and peaceful avocation but she had hitherto been taught to consider the presence of these pigs an absolute necessity was this really the case might not she with her womans wit devise some better expedient by means of which the obnoxious animals could be dispensed with and at the same time waste of skimmilk and whey avoided,0
leaving the yard she betook herself to the orchard where a few more porcine families were taking exercise their presence somewhat detracted from the picturesque appearance of the place which though the blooth or blossom had long since fallen had still a considerable share of beauty of its own the sunlight beating down now through the delicate green leafage brought out wonderful silvery lights from the lichened trunks and outlined the curiously gnarled branches it struck out a golden path across the lush grass for rosalie to walk on and she passed slowly down the glade with bent head and serious face,0
turning when she reached the end to retrace her steps she saw a wellknown sturdy form approaching her and advanced to meet isaac sharpe still with a certain queenly air and without quickening her pace isaacs countenance on the contrary wore a perturbed and puzzled expression his brow was anxiously furrowed and he gazed hard at mrs fiander as he hastened towards her,0
im afeared yeve had a deal o trouble here he began,0
and it did nt altogether answer said the farmer with a nervous laugh,0
oh yes it answered very well i think the men know im in earnest now,0
them two hunts come round to my place at dinnertime they were in a taking poor chaps but twill do them good all the same i think id let em off if i was you mrs fiander job be a roughish sort o chap but he be a good cowman an abel he be wonderful with the management o pigs,0
im not going to let them off said rosalie her face hardening again as she thought of abels maniacal dance and of the loud voice which had frightened her and of jobs insolent manner when he had said the missus baint to my likin,0
well but twill be a bit ard to find as good isaac objected praps yell not better yourself i doubt t will be harder for you to get on wi strange men,0
i am not going to put strange men in their place i am not going to hire any more men im going to have women i can manage women very well,0
but my dear cried isaac opening his eyes very wide and speaking in horrorstricken tones women cant do mens work,0
no but they can do womens work i have thought it all out mr sharpe and my mind is made up job and abel must go i shall put sam belbin in jobs place,0
well he have behaved well to ee conceded isaac unwillingly but he be young i doubt if hes fit for t,0
ive watched him returned rosalie positively and i think hes quite fit for it he has worked under job for some time and is a capital milker i think he will manage very well as to abel i shall put no one in his place for i mean to sell the pigs,0
sell the pigs ejaculated isaacat this time o year his face became absolutely tragic but rosalie merely nodded,0
why whats to become o your skimmilk he gasped an the whey and that,0
there will be no skimmilk said rosalie i shall make blue vinney cheese as i used to make when i was with my grandfather some people are very fond of it that is made entirely of skimmilk you know as for the whey there will not be much nourishment in it but i shall keep a few sows still just to consume that and the buttermilk they will not require much attention as they walk about here you see and there is always a lot of waste green stuff,0
i dont think yell find many folks here what cares for the blue vinney cheese said isaac still much dejected nay t is all the haskim as they likes hereabouts the blue vinney has gone out o fashion so to speak,0
if they dont buy them here i can send them to dorchester said the widow resolutely they used to buy them up there faster than i could make them so you see there will be no waste mr sharpe there will be less work to do outside and therefore i shall not miss job or abel but as we shall be very busy in the dairy i must have two or three extra women to help me,0
isaac stared at her ruefully she looked brighter than she had done since her husbands death but she also looked determined he shook his head slowly his mind was of the strictly conservative order and the contemplated abolition of pigs from the premises of this large dairyfarm seemed to him an almost sacrilegious innovation moreover to sell pigs in july to make cheeses that nobody in that part of the world cared to eat to replace two seasoned men who knew their businesswhatever might be their faultswith that dangerous commodity womankindthe whole experiment seemed to him utterly wild and pregnant with disaster,0
i mean to do it said rosalie defying the condemnation in his face by this time next year you will congratulate me on my success,0
i hope so i am sure said isaac in a slightly offended tone i came here to advise ee but it seems ye dont want no advice,0
oh yes i do she cried softening in a moment i value it of all things mr sharpe my one comfort in my difficulties is the thought that i can talk them over with you i have laid my plan before you quite simply in the hope that you would approve,0
well my dear said isaac somewhat mollified i dont approve d ye see since you ask my advice ill tell ye plain that i dont think the plan will work ye wont be able to sell your pigs to begin with then yell want a man wi more experience than sam to look after the cows it baint such easy worknay that it baint then as to gettin more women bout the place i dont hold with the notion i dont think it ud benefit ye my dear i dont trewly,0
think it over mrs fiander he urged dont do nothing in a hurry that be my advice,0
thank you very much yes ill think it over youll come on sunday wont you mr sharpe,0
ees agreed isaac doubtfully ees ill come on sunday i be main glad you be thinking of taking my advice mrs fiander,0
i am grateful to you for giving it said rosalie with a sweet smile and the farmer walked away thinking that on the whole women were far less unreasonable than he had hitherto supposed,0
the next day was thursdayearly closing day at branstontherefore no one was surprised when mrs fiander having as she averred some business to do in the town ordered the gig in the forenoon it was the first time she had used that vehicle since her husbands death and she looked sorrowful enough as she climbed into it clad in her deepest weeds,0
the steady old horse looked round when she gathered up the reins as though wondering at the innovationfor elias had always been accustomed to driveand was with some difficulty induced to start,0
nigger be so wise as a christian that he be commented bundy as the gig and its occupant disappeared he was astandin and awaitin for master so sensible as i mid do myself but hell have to get used to the change the same as the rest of us,0
ay an praps hell not like it so very well returned abel sardonically give a woman a whip in her hand and she fancies shes bound to lay it on,0
but nigger was suffered to jog along the road at his own pace for the old sadness which had fallen upon rosalie had for a moment checked her eager spirit and a new preoccupation was moreover now added to it would elias approve of what she was about to do or would he agree with isaac no surely he would say that she knew best he was always pleased with anything she did he used to say that she was the best manager he had ever known and on the other hand used frequently to speak of isaacs notions with goodhumoured derision it will be seen that mrs fianders meditations over her friends advice had resulted as indeed might have been expected in the determination to adhere to her original plan and she was now on her way to interview two personages whose cooperation would be necessary in carrying it out,0
her appearance in the shop of mr hardy the principal grocer of the town caused a certain amount of commotion everybody turned to look at the beautiful young widow who had indeed for many days past formed the principal topic of conversation among the townsfolk and much interest was aroused by her murmured request to see mr hardy in private,0
certainly mrs fiander step this way maam john open the door there,0
john hardy a tall goodlooking young man in a white linen jacket hastened to obey his parents behest and was even good enough to accompany the visitor along the passage which led from the shop to the family sittingroom it was empty at this hour mrs hardy being presumably occupied in household duties and mr john ushered rosalie in with much ceremony and invited her to be seated in the best armchair,0
some disappointment was perceptible in his ingenuous countenance when he found that the interview which had been so mysteriously asked for was merely connected with cheese but his father listened to rosalies proposition with grave attention,0
i dont exactly see how the plan would work he remarked shaking his head we sell your haskim cheeses very fairly well mrs fiander mr hardy was a discreet person and was determined not to commit himself but as for the blue vinney id be very glad to oblige you but im really afraidyou see theres scarcely any demand for blue vinney nowadays a few of the old folks ask for it now and then but we dont get not to say a reglar custom for t and it would nt be worth our while to keep it,0
i am considered a particularly good hand at making blue vinney said rosalie i used to be quite celebrated for it when i lived near dorchesterin fact i could easily sell my cheeses now at dorchester only i thought i would give you the first offer as you have dealt with me so long,0
growing warm in her excitement she threw back her veil john hardy gazing at her flushed cheeks and sparkling eyes thought mrs fiander had never looked so handsome as in her widows weeds,0
dorchester commented the senior that would be a long way for you to send maam,0
i am sure put in the son quickly wed be sorry to think as mrs fiander should need to take her cheeses to dorchester father,0
the elder mr hardy glanced from one to the other of the two young faces and as rosalie bestowed a grateful smile upon his son an idea seemed to strike him,0
well he said goodnaturedly you are trying an experiment i understand mrs fiander theres always a certain amount o risk in an experiment but still nothing venture nothing have they say if youre willing to venture i shall be glad to help you all i can send your cheeses to me and ill do my best to sell em i wont promise to pay money down for em he added cautiously same as i do for the haskims but ill try an sell em for you and we can settle about them after,0
i am very much obliged said rosalie a little blankly however for she had not been accustomed to do business in this manner,0
we will use our utmost endeavours to push the goodsof that you may be sure cried young john eagerly and she smiled upon him again so graciously that he somewhat lost his head and made several incoherent statements as to the excellence of blue vinney cheese for which his worthy father subsequently brought him to book,0
thats not the way to get round a woman my lad he remarked mrs f will just think you be right down silly the notion o tellin her as blue vinney cheese was richer to the palate than rammilwhy rammils made altogether o good new milk and this heres nothin but skim she makes cheese o skim instead o givin it to the pigs and you go and tell her all that rubbish shes no foolthe widow is ntthat is nt the way to make up to her,0
meanwhile rosalie had driven across the marketplace and up a side street to the house of a certain auctioneer and to her great joy found him at home,0
he was a stout middleaged man with some pretensions to good looks and more to being a dandy he was attired in a sporting costume of quite correct cut and received his visitor with an air of jovial hospitality,0
delighted to see you im sure mrs fiander i feel honoured i am at your service for anything you may wishyou may command me maam,0
rosalie had begun by expressing a desire to transact a little business with him and now proceeded to explain its nature,0
i wish to sell my pigs by auction she said i have about sixtyfive to dispose of and i should like the sale to take place as early as possible next week,0
buthave you considered the question it would be difficult to sell off such a number of pigs at any season of the year but nowin the height of the summer if i may advise you mrs fiander dont be in such a hurry wait and sell the pigs at a more convenient time nobodys killing pigs now and most people as go in for fatting pigs have got as many as they want by this time,0
it must be next week said the widow obstinately job and abel were leaving on the saturday and the stock must be got rid of before the new era began,0
youll lose to a certainty maam said mr wilson running his hand through his welloiled hair what with all the regulations on account of the swine fever the selling of such a number of pigs would be a difficult matterat any season as i say and you dont give me no time scarcely to get out my bills,0
the sale must take place before saturday week insisted rosalie you must do the best you can for me mr wilson,0
you may rely on that mrs fiander but it really grieves me to think that you should lose so much,0
he paused thoughtfully biting the end of one finger and suffering his eyes meanwhile to travel slowly over the handsome face and graceful figure of his client during this scrutiny he was not unobservant of the rich materials of which her dress was composed and her general appearance of mournful prosperity,0
well ill tell you what ill do he said its against my own interest but i always like to oblige a ladyparticularly such a lady as you mrs fiander ill drive round the country and see if i can persuade people to buy up those pigs by private contract i know a pigjobber over shaftesbury side as might be glad to take a good many off you if he got them at a low price if i understand you mrs fiander the price is not an object to you,0
noo faltered rosalie of course i should like as much money as possible for them but the price is not so important as to get rid of the animals as soon as possible,0
just so agreed the auctioneer cheerfully well mrs fiander i shall lose by it as i say but i will try and arrange matters for you in this way under the circumstances maam i grudge no time or trouble spent in your service i am always thought to be a ladys manmy late poor wife used to say that my consideration for ladies injured the business but as i used to tell her a man has a heart or else he has nt if he has a heartif he has more feelings than his neighbours he is nt to blame for it let the business go my dear i d say but dont ask me to be hard on a woman,0
it had been whispered among the gossips of branston that during the lifetime of the late mrs wilson her lord had been wont to correct her occasionally with a bootjack but these rumours had not reached rosalies ears and even if they had she would probably have disbelieved them nevertheless she did not quite like the manner in which the gallant auctioneer leered at her nor his unnecessarily warm pressure of her hand on saying goodbye,0
she drove homewards with a mixture of feelings the inauguration of her new plan seemed to involve a considerable amount of risk not to say loss she felt conscious of the fact that she owed her very partial success more to the persuasion of her beauty than to faith in her prospects as a woman of business yet there was after all satisfaction in thinking that she had carried her point,0
he that will not love must be my scholar and learn this of me there be in love as many fears as the summers corn has ears,0
wouldst thou know besides all these how hard a woman t is to please how cross how sullen and how soon she shifts and changes like the moon,0
it was with some trepidation that rosalie awaited isaacs visit on the sunday following that long and eventful week the good fellow was indeed so overcome when he found himself seated once more in the familiar chair with the vacant place opposite to him that she had not courage to make a confession which would she knew distress and annoy hima confession which would have to be made nevertheless,0
her own eyes filled as she saw isaac unaffectedly wiping away his tears with his great redandyellow handkerchief and for some moments no word was spoken between them she filled his pipe and lit it for him but he suffered it to rest idly between his fingers and made no attempt to sip at the tumbler of spirits and water which she placed at his elbow,0
lets talk of him she murmured softly at last bending forward tell me about when you knew him first,0
lard said sharpe with a sniff i knowd him all his life i may say i were with him when he were confirmedand i were at both his weddins yours was the only one i was nt at,0
rosalie straightened herself feeling as if a douche of cold water had been unexpectedly applied to her,0
ah went on isaac shaking his head mournfully i knowed his fust and his second missus wellthey was nice women both on em the fust was a bit near but as poor lias used to say twas a good fault ah hed say thata good fault,0
he put his pipe between his lips and immediately took it out again,0
the second mrs fiander he went on was a good creatur toovery savin delicate though but hed alays make allowances her husband would though it did seem to me sometimes as it was a bit disheartenin to a man when his wife got the titus just at the busiest time of year ah he used to tell me often as it were nt no use to be a dairyfarmer without you had a active wife,0
rosalie fidgeted in her chair these little anecdotes of isaac seemed to her rather pointless under the present circumstances,0
all i can say is she remarked after a pause that i always found poor dear elias the most considerate of men,0
i d low ye did said isaac turning his moist eyes upon her he thought a deal o youhe did that says he to me the first night i come here when you come home arter getting wed i d low says he shes the best o the three,0
there was comfort in this thought and rosalie looked gratefully at her visitor whose eyes had again become suffused with tears as he recalled this touching tribute,0
he used to say she observed presently in a low voice that i was a very good manager but i dont think it was on that account alone he was so fond of me,0
ees he did use to say you was a wonderful manager said isaac disregarding the latter part of the sentence many a time heve atold me that you had nt got no equal as a manager,0
sentiment was evidently not to be the order of the day but here at least was an opportunity of introducing the little matter of business which weighed so heavily on rosalies conscience,0
i think she said diffidently he would say i was wise in carrying out this new plan,0
what new plan inquired isaac pausing with his handkerchief halfway to his eyes and turning towards her sternly though the tears hung upon his grizzled lashes,0
why the one i spoke to you ofabout doing away with the pigs you know she returned faintly,0
that there notion that i gie ye my advice agen said sharpe grimly,0
yes hesitatingly i thought it over as you told me to and i did nt think i could manage differently i find i can sell the pigs all right and mr hardy has promised to try and dispose of my blue vinney cheeses,0
isaac blew his nose returned his handkerchief to his pocket and stood up,0
im glad to hear as ye can manage so well he said sarcastically you dont want no advice thats plain and i shant never offer you none agen ill wish ye good day mrs fiander,0
oh dont go away like that cried she piteously please dont be offended with me such an old friend,0
at this moment a figure passed across the window and a loud knock was heard at the housedoor rosalie rushed to the door of the parlour,0
dont let any one in susan she cried say imim engaged stay at least a minute mr sharpei want to tell youi want to explain,0
throwing out one hand in pleading she held open the parlour door an inch or two with the other and presently the manly tones of mr cross were heard through the chink,0
i am sorry to hear that mrs fiander is engaged will you kindly inform her that i will call next sunday,0
tell him susan said her mistress opening the door a little way and speaking under her breathtell him that i am always engaged on sunday,0
susan was heard to impart this information and then the visitors tones were heard again,0
thats a pity tell her if you please that i shall ope to have the pleasure of finding her at home some afternoon during the week,0
i am always out in the afternoon said rosalie speaking this time so decidedly that it was not necessary for susan to repeat her words,0
oh said the young man addressing this time not the maid but the bright eye of which he caught a glimpse through the door then i shall take my chance of finding you in the morning,0
i am too busy to see anyone in the morning retorted rosalie and she shut the door with a finality which left mr cross no option but to depart,0
you see i do take your advice sometimes said rosalie turning to isaac and speaking in a plaintive tone though a little smile played about her mouth,0
isaacs back was towards her and he made no reply as she approached the burly form however she saw his shoulders heave and presently to her great relief discovered that he was shaking with silent laughter,0
well my dear ye dont do things by halvesill say that for ee he chuckled youve agot rid o that there chap anyhow hell not ax to come coortin again well well if ye manage as well in other ways ill not say that ye baint fit to look arter yourself,0
but it was your advice you know mr sharpe she said demurely you gave me the hint about shutting the door,0
i d low i did said isaac and being a goodnatured and placable person his transitory sense of resentment was soon replaced by thorough appreciation of the humorous side of the situation,0
the discomfiture of samuel cross gave a salutary lesson not only to himself but to sundry other adventurous young men who had been a little hasty in their overtures to mrs fiander it was soon noised abroad that the young widow wished for the present to keep herself to herself as the saying went and that it would in consequence be advisable to abstain from making advances to herat least until she had laid aside her crape,0
for some months therefore rosalie enjoyed comparative immunity from the importunities which had so much annoyed her while the new arrangements appeared to work amazingly well both within and without littlecomb farm,0
job and abel departed in due course the pigs were soldat considerable loss to their owner sam was installed as chief cowman and sustained his honours cheerfully without however appearing to be unduly elated and three strapping damsels were engaged as dairymaids with their cooperation mrs fiander turned out weekly a score and more of large round cheeses which were stowed away in an upper room until in course of time they should become sufficiently ripesome people might use the term mouldyto have earned their title of blue vinney cheese,0
this process took a considerable time and meanwhile the profits of the dairy were a good deal lessened since rosalie had left off making the haskim cheeses for which she had been so particularly famed and for which she had invariably received regular payment still as she told herself when the blue vinneys were disposed of she would receive her money in a lump sum and all would be the same in the end,0
her chief trouble at this time arose from the frequent calls of mr wilson the auctioneer who though he could not be said to be regularly paying attention to rosalie found nevertheless sundry excuses for dropping in and conversing with her at all manner of unseasonable times he made as has been implied no direct advances and rosalie moreover could not treat him so unceremoniously as she had treated mr cross for she felt in a manner indebted to him about the sale of those unlucky pigs he had carried the matter through for her with great difficulty to himself as he frequently assured her and he had steadily refused all remuneration it was hard therefore for the young widow to repel or avoid him and she was in consequence reluctantly obliged to endure many hours of his society,0
your own fair youth you care so little for it smiling towards heaven you would not stay the advances of time and change upon your happiest fancies i keep your golden hour and will restore it,0
one september day rosalie betook herself to the little churchyard where elias lay at rest three months had elapsed since he had been taken from her and she had not let a week pass without visiting and decorating his grave she thought of him often and her affectionate regret was in no way diminished yet though she was now on her way to perform this somewhat melancholy duty she advanced with a bright face and a rapid bounding step,0
she was young full of vigour and elasticity and on such a day as thisan exquisite golden day full of sunshine and yet with a tartness hinting of approaching autumn in the airevery fibre of her being thrilled with the very joy of life,0
when she knelt by her husbands grave however her face became pensive and her movements slow taking a pair of garden shears from the basket which she carried she clipped the short grass closer still laid the flowers gently down on the smooth surface placed the dead ones in her basket and after lingering a moment bent forward and kissed the new white headstone,0
as she rose and turned to go away her face still shadowed by tender regret she suddenly perceived that she was not alone at a little distance from her ensconced within the angle of the churchyard wall a man was sitting with an easel in front of him above the large board on the easel she caught sight of a brown velveteen coat and a flannel shirt loosely fastened with a brilliant tie also of a dark face framed in rather long black hair and shaded by a soft felt hat of peculiar shape from beneath its tilted brim however a pair of keen dark eyes were gazing with intense curiosity at the young woman and though he held a palette in one hand and a brush in the other he was evidently more interested in her than in his painting,0
rosalie vexed that her recent display of feeling had been observed by this stranger walked quickly down the little path colouring high with displeasure the while and assuming that stately carriage which came naturally to her in such emergencies,0
the gentleman turned slowly on his campstool his eyes twinkling and his dark moustache twitching and watched her till she was out of sight,0
rosalie was clad in her morning print and wore her widebrimmed chip hat so that her attire gave no indication of her station in life as her tall figure disappeared the man rose stepped past his easelwhich supported a canvas whereon already appeared in bold firm lines a sketch of the antiquated church porchand made his way up the path and across the grass to elias fianders grave,0
let us see he murmured that kiss spoke volumes it must be a sweetheart at the very least yet when she came swinging down the meadowpath she certainly looked heartwhole here we area brandnew stone funny nameelias fiander noaged sixtytwo must have been her father or perhaps her grandfatherthe girl looked young enoughso all my pretty romance has come to nothing i wish she had stayed a few minutes longeri would give something to make a sketch of her,0
he went back to his work whistling and thinking over rosalies beautiful face and figure regretfully and with an admiration that was entirely sthetic for he had a cheery rotund little wife at home in london and half a dozen children to provide for so that he was not given to sentiment,0
it was perhaps because his admiration was so innocent and his ambition so laudable that a few days later his wish to transfer rosalies charms to canvas was granted in a most unexpected way,0
it had been unusually hot and the artist having finished his sketch of the porch was proceeding by a short cut through littlecomb farm to the downs beyond in search of cooler air when on crossing a cornfield at the further end of which the reapers were busily at work he suddenly came upon a womans figure lying in the shade of a shock of sheaves,0
the first glance announced her identity the second assured him that she was fast asleep she had removed her hat and her clasped hands supported her head the upward curve of the beautiful arms being absolutely fascinating to the artists eye the oval face with its warm colouring the slightly loosened masses of dark hair were thrown into strong relief by the golden background the absolute abandonment of the whole form was so perfect in its grace that he paused trembling with artistic delight and hardly daring to breathe lest he should disturb her,0
but rosalie overcome with the heat and tired out after a hard mornings work slept peacefully on while he swung his satchel round opened it quickly and began with swift deft fingers to make a rapid sketch of her a few light pencil strokes suggested the exquisite lines of the prostrate form and he had already begun to dash on the colour when with a loud shriek and flapping of wings a blackbird flew out of the neighbouring hedge and rosalie stirred and opened her eyes,0
rosalies eyes always took people by surprise and the artist who had not before noticed their colour suffered his to rest upon them appreciatively while they were still hazy with sleep but when with returning consciousness he observed a sudden wonder and indignation leap into them he threw out his hand hastily,0
one moment if you pleasestay just as you are for one moment,0
still under the influence of her recent heavy slumber and taken aback by the peremptory tone rosalie obeyed,0
what are you doing she inquired suspiciously but without changing her posture,0
dont you see he returned i am making a picture of you,0
a warm tide of colour spread over the upturned face,0
a man must take his chances where he finds them said the artist i dont often get such a chance as this i am a poor man and cant afford to let an opportunity slip,0
he had a shrewd sallow face and kind merry eyes and as he spoke he paused in his work and smiled down at her,0
i dont want to be disobliging said rosalie but ii dont like it i fell asleep by accidenti should nt have thrown myself down like this if i had thought anyone was likely to see me,0
all the better commented he you could nt have put yourself into such a position if you had tried to it has evidently come naturally and it is simply perfect,0
he paused to squeeze out a little colour from one of the tiny tubes in his open box and again smiled encouragingly down at his model,0
now will you oblige me by closing your eyes again no dont screw them up like that let the lids drop gentlyso very good t is a pity to hide the eyesone does not often see blue eyes with such murillo colouring but the length of the lashes makes amends and i want you asleep,0
again a wave of colour swept over rosalies face the stranger marked it approvingly and worked on,0
is it nearly done she inquired presently you said you would only be a moment,0
i find it will take several moments but i am sure you would not grudge me the time if you knew what a wonderful piece of good fortune this is for me,0
dont frown please let the lids lie loosely i will tell you why i consider this meeting a piece of good fortune do you know what it is to make breadandbutter,0
i make butter three times a week returned rosalie somewhat amused and i make bread too sometimes,0
well i have got to make breadandbutter every day of my life not only for myself but for my wife and six small children and i have nothing to make it with but this you may open your eyes for a moment if you dont move otherwise,0
rosalie opened her eyes and saw that he was bending towards her and holding out a paintbrush,0
now go to sleep again he went on yes thats what i make my breadandbutter with and it is nt always an easy task because there are a great many other chaps who want to make breadandbutter in the same kind of way and we can never be quite sure which among the lot of us will find the best market for his wares but i shall have no difficulty in disposing of you i am certaintherefore i consider myself in luck,0
do you mean that you will sell that little picture of me,0
not this one but a big one which i shall make from it it will go to an exhibition and people will come and look at it as the subject is quite new and very pretty i shall ask a big price for it and there will be lots of breadandbutter for a long time to come,0
but would anybody care to buy a picture of a woman whom they dont know lying asleep in a cornfield cried rosalie incredulously and involuntarily raising her drooped lids,0
most certainly they will responded the artist confidently this will be a lovely thing when it is done i shall come here tomorrow and make a careful study of this stook against which you are lying and of the field and i shall look about for a few good types of harvesters to put in the middle distance he was speaking more to himself than to her but rosalie listened with deep interest and watched him sharply through her halfclosed lids suddenly she saw him laugh,0
perhaps if i come across a very attractive specimen of a rustic i may place him just behind the stook here peering through the sheaves at you or bending forward as if he were going to,0
oh dont cried rosalie starting violently and opening her eyes wide no i wont have it i wont be in the picture at all if you put anything of that kind in,0
notif i chose a particularly nice young man inquired the painter still laughing softly to himself not if i chosethe young man,0
i am sure i dont know what you mean protested she her cheeks crimson again and her lips quivering there is no young man,0
do you mean to tell me my dear child that with that face you have lived till now without anyone courting youas i suppose they would call it,0
oh of course they court me rosalie hastened to admit but i hate them all and they are all very ugly she added eagerly and would look dreadful in a picture,0
there you are frowning again come let us talk of something less exciting keep still please so you make butter three times a week do you you are a farmers daughter i suppose,0
i was a farmers granddaughter she returned my father was a schoolmaster,0
no father died when i was quite a baby but my grandfather sent me to school,0
no i live alone here this farm belongs to me,0
she could not help peeping out beneath her lashes to judge of the effect of her words and was gratified when the busy brush paused and the dark eyes glanced down at her in astonishment,0
you live alone here but this is a big farmyou cant manage it all yourself,0
yes i do it is hard work but i contrive to do it i am rather lonely though,0
that will be remedied in time said the artist encouragingly the right man will come along and perhaps he added with that queer smile of his you wont find him so ugly as the rest,0
you dont know who i am or you would nt speak like that said rosalie with dignity adding with a softer inflexion of her voice the right man has comeand gone i am a widow,0
and unclasping the hands beneath her head she thrust forward the left one with the shining weddingring,0
confusion and concern now replaced the careless gaiety of the strangers face,0
i beg your pardon he said earnestly i did not know you look so youngi could not guessbut i am very sorry for my foolish talk,0
i was married four years said rosalie softly something gentle and kindly about the man invited confidence my poor elias has only been dead three months she paused abruptly astonished at the sudden expression of blank bewilderment on the others face,0
your husbands name was elias he queried i beg your pardon for what must seem idle curiosity was itwas it his grave that i saw you visiting the other day,0
yes said rosalie sighing and blushing yes ii thought i was alone,0
aged sixtytwo quoted the artist to himself and he raised his hand to his mouth for a moment to conceal its telltale quivering he thought of the girls elastic gait on the morning when he had first seen her and scrutinised once more the blooming face and admirably proportioned form before him then shaking his head slowly went on with his work,0
perhaps i shall call this picture the sleeping beauty he observed after a pause with apparent irrelevance you know the story dont you,0
yes but i dont think it would be a good name she was a princess who went to sleep in a palace in the wood and i am just iin my working dress asleep in a cornfield,0
these are mere details said he the main points of the story are the same she woke up all right you know you will wake up some day too my beauty,0
he put such meaning into the words and smiled down at her so oddly that she felt confused and uncomfortable it was not that her pride was wounded at the liberty he had taken in applying such a term to her his admiration was so evidently impersonal that it could not offend her and moreover his allusion to his wife and children had had a tranquillising effect but the mans look and tone when he made this strange remark filled her with vague disquietude both betrayed a secret amusement mingled with something like compassion she would wake up some day he said but she did not want to wake up she was quite happyat least as happy as could be in her bereaved stateshe asked nothing more from life it would be certainly more unpleasant than the reverse to discover that life had surprises in store for her but why need she trouble herself about a prophecy so idly uttered and by an absolute stranger nevertheless she did trouble herself not only throughout the remainder of the time that the artist was completing his sketch but frequently afterwards,0
you will wake up some day my beauty oh no no let her sleep on if this placid contented existence were indeed sleep let her dream away the days in peace until that time of awakening which would reunite her to elias,0
then proud celinda hope no more to be implord or wood since by thy scorn thou dost restore the wealth my love bestowd and thy disdain too late shall find that none are fair but who are kind,0
when the artist had gone away after lingering some days longer to complete his studies for the projected picture the tenor of rosalies existence flowed on as calmly as even she could desire she made and sold her butter had her cheeses conveyed to mr hardys establishment in branston superintended the harvesting of her potatoes and mangels laid in her winter store of oilcake and fattened sundry turkeys and geese for the christmas market,0
early on a winters afternoon rosalie fiander might have been seen walking slowly across the downs in the neighbourhood of isaac sharpes farm she carried a large basket and every now and then paused to add to the store of scarlet berries or shining evergreen which she was culling from thicket and hedgerow for christmas decoration,0
all at once she was surprised by hearing a step on the path behind her and a mans voice calling her name and turning descried the tall and somewhat ungainly person of andrew burge,0
though it wanted yet a few days of christmas that gentleman who was of a social turn of mind had evidently begun to celebrate the festival and rosalie gazing at him was somewhat dismayed on perceiving the flushed hilarity of his countenance and the devious gait by which he approached,0
she paused reluctantly however and shook hands with him when he came up,0
ive been calling at your place mrs fiander he observed to wish you the compliments of the season,0
i am very much obliged to you said rosalie the same to you mr burge,0
ah said the young man rolling an amorous eye at her i was most wishful mrs fiander to give you my christmas greetings in person,0
you are very good said she i wish you a merry christmas and a happy new year and now i think i must be moving home for i am very busy today,0
allow me to escort you urged andrew t was a disappintment to me not to find you at home i am rejiced to have overtaken you and anxious to prorogue the interview theres a season for condoliances and a season for congratulations this here is the time for congratulations and i am anxious mrs fiander maam to prorogue it,0
my work is waiting for me at home said the young widow in alarm i am afraid i shall have no time to attend to you but perhaps some other day,0
she broke off and began to walk away rapidly but the uneven lumbering steps kept pace with hers,0
christmas comes but once a year remarked mr burge somewhat thickly t is a joyful seasona season as fills a mans eart with ope and appiness,0
this observation appearing to call for no rejoinder rosalie let it pass unnoticed except by a slight quickening of her pace to no purpose however for her unwelcome companion kept by her side,0
christmas for ever he ejaculated huskily with an appropriate flourish of his hat instead of restoring it to its place after this sudden display of enthusiasm he continued to wave it uncertainly not over his own head but over rosalies leering the while in a manner which materially increased her discomposure all at once she saw that a sprig of mistletoe was tucked into the band of mr burges headgear and almost at the moment she made this discovery he lurched forward so as to bar her progress and bent his face towards hers,0
how dare you cried rosalie thrusting him from her with a vigorous push then as he momentarily lost his equilibrium and staggered backwards against the hedge she fairly took to her heels and fled from him at full speed not towards her own home but to isaac sharpes premises,0
o mr sharpe she cried breathlessly oh oh save me hes after me,0
whos arter you my dear why you be ashakin same as an aspentree what in the name o goodness has put you in such a state,0
oh itsits that dreadful andrew burge he overtook me on the downs and tried to kiss me i think hes tipsy and i know hes running after me,0
nay now my dear dont ee take on so hell not hurt ye hereill see to that dang his impidence tried to kiss ye did he that chap needs to be taught his place,0
im sure hes coming down the path now cried rosalie wringing her hands oh dear if he does nt come here i dare say hell go back to the farm and i shall find him there when i go home,0
now dont ee go on shakin and cryin so dont ye be so excited rosalie said isaac who was himself very red in the face and violently perturbed come ill walk home along of ye and if i do find him there ill settle himleastways if youll give me leave ye dont want to have nothin more to say to en do ye very well then t will be easy enough to get rid of en,0
so isaac sharpe without pausing to pull a coat over his smockfrock duly escorted mrs fiander across the downs and home by the short cut and as rosalie had surmised susan greeted them on the threshold with the pleasing information that mr burge was waiting for her in the parlour,0
very good said isaac leave en to me my dear jist you go to the dairy or up to your room or anywheres ye like out o the road ill not be very slack in getting through wi this here job,0
he watched her until she had disappeared from view and then suddenly throwing open the parlour door shouted in stentorian tones to its solitary occupant,0
burge who had been sitting in a somnolent condition before the fire woke up and stared in surprise mingled with alarm at the whiterobed giant who advanced threateningly towards him through the dusk,0
what does this mean repeated the farmer in thundering tones it means that youre a rascal young fellow,0
and isaac qualified the statement with one or two specimens of language of the very choicest kind,0
what do you mean eh he pursued standing opposite the chair where andrew sat blinking by running arter young females on them there lonesome downs when you was not fit for nothin but a public bar frightenin her and insultin her till she was very near took with a fit on my doorstep what do ye mean ye villain eh if ye was nt so drunk that ye could nt stand up to me for a minute id have ye out in that there yard and id give ye summat,0
mr burge shrank as far back in his chair as was compatible with a kind of tipsy dignity and inquired mildly,0
its my business that i wont have lias fianders widow insulted nor yet put upon nor yet bothered by folks as she dont want to ha nothin to say to,0
mr sharpe protested andrewmr sharpe i cannot permit such interference my intentions was honourable i meant matrimony and i will not allow any stranger to come between this lady and me,0
ye meant matrimony did ye said isaac exchanging his loud wrathful tone for one of withering scorn mrs fiander does nt mean matrimony thoughnot wi the likes o you come you clear out o this and dont you never go for to show your ugly mug here again or my cluster o five will soon be no stranger to it i promise you,0
he held up a colossal hand as he spoke first extending the fingers in illustration of his threat and then clenching it into a redoubtable fist,0
andrew sat upright in the elbowchair his expressionless eyes staring stolidly at his assailant but without attempting to move through the open door the sound of whispers and titters could have been heard had either of the men been in a condition to notice such trivial matters,0
this contumacious behaviour mr sharpe sir he said has no effect upon me whatever my intentions is to make an equivocal offer of marriage to mrs fiander and from her lips alone will i take my answer i shall sit in this chair he continued firmly until the lady comes in person to give me her responsory,0
you will will ye bellowed isaac ye be agoin to sit there be ye ye baint though that there chairs my chair id have ye know and ill soon larn ye who have got the right to sit in it,0
with that he lunged forward thrusting the cluster of five so suddenly into andrews face that that gentleman threw himself heavily backwards and the chair being unprovided with castors overbalanced and fell violently to the ground,0
undeterred by the catastrophe and the peculiar appearance presented by mr burges flushed and dazed countenance as he stared helplessly upwards contemplating probably a thousand stars isaac seized the chair by the legs and began to drag it across the floor bumping its occupant unmercifully in his exertions his own countenance was indeed almost as purple in hue as andrews by the time he reached the door which was obligingly thrown open as he neared it revealing sam belbins delighted face the alarmed countenances of the maids peered over his shoulder while a few manly forms were huddled together in the passage mr sharpes extremely audible tones had attracted many eager listeners nothing so exciting had taken place at littlecomb since elias fianders funeral,0
here you chaps cried the farmer still tugging violently at the chair and panting with his efforts here come on some on you lend a hand to get rid o this here carcase,0
nothing loath the men sprang forward and between them the chair with its occupant was dragged out of the room and along the passage,0
whats he been adoin of inquired sam with great gusto as he dropped his particular chairleg on the cobblestones in the yard,0
never you mind what heve been adoin of returned isaac straightening himself and wiping his brow get him out of that there chair and trot him off the premisesthats what you ve agot to do,0
andrew burge was with some difficulty set on his legs and after gazing vacantly round him appeared to recover a remnant of his scattered senses,0
ill summons you mr sharpe he cried the liberties of the british subject is not to be vilently interfered with i leave this spot he added looking round loftily but unsteadily with contumely,0
anyone who had subsequently seen sam and robert conducting the suitor to the high road would have endorsed the truth of this remark though mr burge according to his custom had merely used the first long word that occurred to him without any regard to its appropriateness,0
returning to the house isaac went to the foot of the stairs and called out rosalies name in a mildly jubilant roar,0
come down mrs fiander come down my dear he be gone and wont never trouble you no more ill answer for t,0
rosalie came tripping downstairs smiling in spite of a faintly alarmed expression,0
what a noise you did make to be sure she remarked and what a mess the parlour is in,0
we did knock down a few things i d low when we was cartin en out of this returned isaac apologetically he was asettin in my chair and he up and told me to my face as hed go on asettin there till he seed eethat were comin it a bit too strong,0
he was helping her as he spoke to pick up the scattered furniture and to restore the tablecloth and books which andrew had dragged down in falling to their places,0
these tasks ended he faced her with a jovial smile,0
well he said he wont trouble you again anyhow theres one o your coortin chaps agone for good,0
i wish you could get rid of them all in the same way said rosalie gratefully adding in a confidential tone theres mr wilson nowhe keeps calling and calling and he follows me about and pays me complimentshe is very tiresome,0
be he returned the farmer with a clouded brow ah and he baint a chap for you to be takin notice on nohow id give en the sack if i was you,0
why you see i dont like to be rude and he was kind about the pigs but i wish some one would drop him a hint that he is wasting his time in dangling about me,0
she broke off suddenly for at that moment the interested and excited countenance of sam belbin appeared in the doorway and though he was a favourite with his mistress she did not see fit to discuss such intimate affairs in his hearing,0
the news of isaac sharpes encounter with young andrew burge soon flew round the neighbourhood evoking much comment and causing constructions to be placed upon the farmers motives which if he had heard them would have sorely disquieted that good man,0
he be agoin to coort widow fiander hisself for certain averred mrs paddock d ye mind how i did say that day as there was all the trouble yonder at littlecombhow nice says i master did speak of herd ye mind he were quite undone about her pore young creatur says he so feelin as he could d ye mind mrs belbin i said says i master be a very feelin man,0
ah i can mind as you said that returned mrs belbin but my sam he d low as mrs fiander would nt so much as look at master not another old man says he and mind ye added mrs belbin confidentially dropping her voice sams missus do think a deal o he,0
mrs paddock folded her arms and looked superciliously at her neighbour,0
nay now said she your sam ull find hisself mistook if he gets set on sich a notion as that,0
what notion returned the other innocently i never said nothin about no notion at all youve agot such a suspectin mind mrs paddock theres no tellin you a bit o news wiout you up an take a bodys character away,0
at this moment the impending hostilities between the two matrons were averted by the advent of a thirdmrs stuckhey by name wife of robert stuckhey who worked at littlecomb,0
my usband did say she remarked negligently scratching her elbows as mr sharpe seemed very intimate wi missus my dear he says to her ah stuckhey d say as mr sharpe do often call missus my dear and he did say as he seed en come walkin home wi her this arternoon quite lovin like in a smockfrock jist the same as if he was in his own place go upstairs my dear says he,0
in his smockfrock interrupted mrs paddock eagerly were it a new smockfrock did mr stuckhey say,0
very like it were replied mrs stuckhey accommodatingly my master he baint one as takes much notice and if it had abeen a old one hed scarce ha thought o mentionin it to me,0
then you may depend mrs belbin cried mrs paddock triumphantly as master be acoortin o widow fiander a new smockfrock t is the very thing as a man like he ud wear when his thoughts was bent on sich matters i do mind as my father told me often how he did save an save for eleven weeks to buy hisself a new smock to go acoortin my mother in ah wages was terrible low then and he were nt agettin above seven shillin a week but he did manage to put by a shillin out o that the smockit were a white undid cost eleven shillin and he did save eleven weeks and strange to say when he and my mother did wed they did have eleven children,0
utterly routed by this incontrovertible testimony mrs belbin withdrew to her own quarters leaving the other two ragged heads bobbing together in high enjoyment of the delectable piece of gossip,0
before the morrow the entire village knew that farmer sharpe had arrived at littlecomb with his arm round widow fianders waist that he had spoken to her in the tenderest terms had avowed his intention of hammering each and every one of her suitors and had bought himself a brandnew and beautifully embroidered smockfrock for the express purpose of courting her in it,0
disdain and scorn ride sparkling in her eyes misprising what they look on,0
though isaac sharpe did not consider himself bound to assist rosalie in repelling the advances of mr wilson the auctioneer the wish she had expressed that someone would be kind enough to drop a hint to him had fallen upon other attentive and willing ears,0
sam belbin had laid her words to heart and only waited for an opportunity of proving his goodwill by ridding her of a frequent and unwelcome visitor,0
his chance came at last and he was quick to take advantage of it,0
it was cheeseday and rosalie and her maids had prepared such a quantity that their work was not as usual finished before dinnertime and they were still elbowdeep in curds when mr wilson chanced to look in,0
sam was standing in the outer room swilling out the great cheesevat which had held that morning a hundred and eighty gallons of skimmilk a wonderfully obliging fellow was sam always ready to lend a hand here to do an odd job there and so goodtempered with it all his mistress could often see his smiling mouth open and ready to agree with whatever remark he thought her likely to make long before she had spoken and as she liked contradiction as little as any of her sex her headman advanced the more rapidly in her favour,0
she was anything but gratified when mr wilson appeared on the threshold of the milkhouse and after a brief greeting bent her head over her mould and went on with her work,0
always busy mrs fiander remarked the visitor pleasantly pon my word you ladies put us to shame sometimes we men are idle creatures in comparison with you,0
rosalie made no answer and sam banged about the vat with his stiff brush so energetically that he seemed bent on giving the lie to the auctioneers words,0
i am really quite curious to see how you set about your cheesemaking pursued the latter in mellifluous tones should i be in your way mrs fiander if i was to step in and watch you,0
i am afraid you would nt find it very amusing responded rosalie unwillingly of course if you like but it will really be most uncomfortable for you we are all in such a mess here samirritablywhat a din you do make with that tub,0
sam who had tilted up the tub the better apparently to scrub the bottom now let it go suddenly sending a great portion of its contents splashing across the floor in mr wilsons direction,0
it be all the same he remarked philosophically i were just agoin to swill out this here place,0
and with that he upset a little more of the steaming water upon the floor seized a stiff broom and began to brush the soapy liquid towards the door,0
you might have waited a moment commented his mistress but she spoke with a sweet smile for she saw with the corner of her eye how hastily mr wilson had skipped out of the way anxious to protect his shining boots and immaculate leggings i really cannot invite you in now she added turning to the visitor regretfully pray excuse the mans awkwardness but as she spoke she smiled again on sam,0
she related the anecdote with much gusto to isaac sharpe on the following sunday but he did not seem to appreciate it as much as she had expected,0
that there wilson hes arter you too i suppose i would nt have anything to say to him if i was you he baint steady enough to make a good husbandracin an drinkin and sichlike ah his poor wife she did nt praise him but she suffered poor soul,0
gracious mr sharpe i am sure you need nt warn me you know what my views are besides i hate the man i would nt see him at all if he had nthad nt been rather obliging in a businessway but was nt it clever of sam to get rid of him like that,0
ees agreed the farmer dubiously but dont ee go for to let en take too much on hisself my dear else yell be like to repent it it do never do to let these young fellows get sot up keep en in his place mrs fiander dont let en get presumptious,0
im sure he would never be that she rejoined warmly poor sam hes the humblest creature in the world he goes about his work likelike a machine,0
may be so said isaac incredulously you know him best i suppose but i jist thought id speak my mind out about him,0
rosalie frowned a little and said no more but her faith in sam was not diminished and as time went on she grew to rely more and more on this cheerful and obliging young fellow,0
the gossiping anent the alleged courting of mrs fiander by farmer sharpe was not confined to littlecomb village but soon spread to the more important town of branston with the immediate result of stirring up sundry of the young men belonging to that place who after the discomfiture of samuel cross had deemed it prudent to relax for a time in their attentions to the fascinating widow so long as she had been thought plunged in grief these wooers of hers had been content to bide their time but when it became known that there was actually an avowed suitor in the field and one moreover to whom the lady had given unequivocal tokens of confidence and goodwill they resolved with one accord to bestir themselves lest the prize of which each thought himself most deserving might be secured by another,0
before many days of the new year had passed rosalie found herself absolutely besieged samuel cross actually forced his way past the unwilling susan into the parlour while rosalie was at tea mr wilson lay in wait for her as she was emerging from church on christmas day and made his proposal in due form as he escorted her homewards john hardy inveigled the widow into the back parlour behind the shop ostensibly to discuss the sale of the blue vinneys in reality to lay his hand and heart at her feet,0
rosalie said no to one and all and was astonished at the outburst of indignation which her answer provoked and at the keen sense of illusage under which every one of her suitors appeared to be labouring,0
it was samuel cross who first alluded in rosalies hearing to the prevalent belief that farmer sharpe was paying his court to her and he was somewhat taken aback by the unfeigned merriment which the suggestion evoked,0
you may laugh mrs fiander he said recovering himself after an instant but people are not blind and deaf and though they may be fooled to a certain extent by a lady gentlemen of my profession find it easy to put two and two together maam when a lady tells you she is always engaged on a sunday and shuts the door in the face of a person who comes to make civil inquiries one does nt need to be extra clever to guess that there must be some reason for it and when the reason turns out to be another gentleman and when that gentleman takes upon himself to assault another gentleman as was also desirous of paying his respects in the same quarter that mrs fiander is what one may term primfacie evidence,0
whether the display of mr crosss learning had a sobering effect on mrs fiander or whether she was suddenly struck by some serious thought it is certain that she ceased laughing at this juncture and remained pensive even after the rejected suitor had departed,0
mr wilson was harder to get rid of he was so confident in the justice of his claim so pertinacious in reminding rosalie of her obligations towards him with regard to the sales of the pigswhich piece of business he perseveringly alluded to as a delicate matterso persuaded moreover of his own superiority to any of her other lovers that she finally lost patience and petulantly declared that if there were not another man in the world she would not consent to marry him,0
the auctioneer grew purple in the face and suddenly changed his note,0
if there was nt another man in the world he repeated sneeringly then there is another man ha it is nt very hard to guess who well tastes differ if you like such a rough common old chap better than a gentleman doing a large and honourable business i make you a present of him mrs fiander smockfrock and all ha ha hell soon have the pigs back again when hes master here and all my labour and loss of time will have been thrown away not that i grudge the sacrifice cried mr wilson in a melting tone no far be it from me to grudge the sacrifice the ladies have always found an easy prey in me and when i think of the far greater sacrifice which a young and lovely woman is prepared to make upon the altar of matrimonya sacrifice which she will repent too latei am rejooced to silence,0
here mr wilson thumped his breast and cast a last languishing look at the young widow who appeared however to be absorbed in her own reflections,0
he talked on in spite of his last assertion until they reached rosalies door where waking as if from a dream she extended her hand to him,0
goodbye she said there is no use in talking about it any more mr wilson my mind is made up,0
the auctioneer extended his hand dramatically in the direction of the empty pigsties,0
well mrs fiander he cried if the inspector of nuisances visits your premises you will only have yourself to thank,0
meanwhile retorted rosalie with some acerbity as it might be a little difficult to send for him today i should be glad if the nuisance who is now occupying my premises would take himself off,0
she went into the house with a flushed face but seemed more thoughtful than annoyed during the remainder of the day,0
it was however with unmixed vexation that she perused on the morning following her rejection of young john hardy a document signed by the firm which ran thus,0
madamre blue vinney cheeseswe regret to inform you that we can no longer allow our premises to be used as a storehouse for these unsaleable articles in the three months during which in order to oblige you we have placed our establishment at your disposal we have only found one purchaser for a small portion of the goods in question as you will see per statement copied from our books and enclosed herewith under these circumstances we are returning to you today as many of the cheeses as the carriers cart can convey and we shall be obliged by your removing the remainder at your earliest convenience,0
the enclosed statement testified to the purchase by one margaret savage of lb blue vinney cse at d d which sum had been credited to mrs fianders account,0
rosalie gave a little gasp and tears of vexation sprang to her eyes,0
they just want to spite me she said of course the cheeses are hardly fit for use yetthey cant have even tried to dispose of them they simply pretended to sell them so as to entrap me and now they are throwing them back on my hands before i have time to think what to do with them that odious john hardy meanspirited wretchit is all his doing,0
even as she thus cogitated there was a rattling of wheels without and the carriers cart drew up with a flourish at the door,0
please maam cried susan thrusting in her head mr smith be here with ever so many cheeses as he says hardys are sending back and theres sixteenandeightpence to pay and he says maam will you please send the men to unload them at once,0
call sam said her mistress in a strangled voice tell him to come at once with two or three of the others and to take the cheeses carefully upstairs,0
why the cheeseroom be amost full maam i doubt therell not be much room for them there we was waitin you know till christmas had gone over a bit to send the last load to town,0
pile them up in the dairy then for the present well why dont you go she cried irritably as the girl remained staring at her make the men get to work at once while i find my purse,0
as she came down from her room purse in hand she observed through the staircase window the blank faces of sam and his underlings as the carrier tossed the cheeses to them from the cart grinning the while as though at some excellent joke she stamped her foot and caught her breath with a little angry sob she had been so proud in despatching to branston load after load of these fine round cheeses she had often congratulated herself on the wisdom and cleverness of this expedient of hersand now to have them ignominiously thrown back at her without having even disposed of oneto be turned into a laughingstock for her own folks as well as for the whole town of branston to be actually made to pay for the illsuccess of her experiment rosalie was as a rule openhanded and generous enough but the disbursal of this particular sixteenandeightpence caused her a pang of almost physical anguish,0
half an hour later when the carrier had departed and the men returned to their work she entered the dairy and stood gazing with clasped hands and a melancholy countenance at the heaps of despised blue vinneys which were piled up on every side,0
to her presently came sam belbin his arms dangling limply by his sides his expression duly composed to sympathetic gloom,0
oh sam exclaimed rosalie in a heartbroken tone pointing tragically to the nearest yellow mound,0
i would nt take on im sure mum responded sam with a ghastly smile nay now i would nt take on t was very ill done o mr hardyso everybody do say but hes that graspinhe never do care for sellin a bit o cheese to poor folkst is all bacon bacon wi he dont ee go for to fill your stummicks wi that there ard cheese i ve aheard him say myself buy a bit o bacon as ull stand to ye hot or cold,0
bacon ejaculated rosalie with a note of even deeper woe then pointing to the cheeses again she groaned oh sam was it worth while getting rid of the pigsfor this,0
dear heart alive mum responded belbin plucking up his courage and speaking more cheerfully mr hardy baint the only grocer in branston there be amany more as ud be proud an glad to sell them cheeses for ye,0
no no why the story must be all over the town by nowno one will look at them in branston everyone will know that mr hardy packed them back to me no if i sell them at all i must send them away somewhereto dorchester perhaps,0
well and that ud be a good notion mum commented belbin youd get a better price for them there i d low lard at dorchester the blue vinney cheeses do go off like smoke,0
there is always a sale for them there to be sure said rosalie somewhat less lugubriously,0
and our own horses and carts ud take them there in less than no time pursued sam more and more confidently things have just fell out lucky it be agoin to take up tonight and i d low therell be some sharpish frostisst will just exercise the horses nicely to get them roughed and make em carry them cheeses to dorchestert will be the very thing as ull do them good and itll cost ye nothing he added triumphantly,0
well sam you are a good comforter cried his mistress brightening up under the influence of his cheerfulness t is a blessing i am sure to have someone about one who does nt croak,0
she turned to him as she spoke with one of her radiant smilesa smile however which very quickly vanished for sams face wore a most peculiar expression,0
why my dear he cried casting an ardent look upon her i be main glad to hear ye say so id ax nothin better nor to be about ye always an id comfort an do for ye so well as i could t is a thing he added with modest candour as ive ahad in my mind for some time but i did nt like to speak afore i was nt sure as yed relish the notion but now as youve ahinted so plain,0
rosalie had averted her face for a moment but as he advanced towards her with extended arm she flashed round upon him a glance which suddenly silenced him,0
he remained staring at her with goggling eyes and a dropping jaw during the awful pause which succeeded,0
he heaved a sigh of relief however when she at last broke silence for she spoke calmly and her words seemed innocuous enough,0
yes mum responded sam no longer the lover but the very humble servant,0
go and get it then your cap i think is on the table,0
she fumbled in her pocket for a moment and presently drew forth her purse from which she counted out the sum of fourteen shillings her eyes had a steely glitter in them as she fixed them on sam,0
here are your weeks wages she said take them and walk out of this house,0
go out of this house repeated rosalie pointing mercilessly to the door and never let me see your face again out of my sight she added quickly as he still hesitated,0
sams inarticulate protests died upon his lips and he turned and left her rosalie looking after him with gleaming eyes until his figure was lost to sight,0
follow a shadow it still flies you seem to fly it it will pursue so court a mistress she denies you let her alone she will court you say are not women truly then styled but the shadows of us men,0
who by resolves and vows engagd does stand for days that yet belong to fate does like an unthrift mortgage his estate before it falls into his hand,0
isaac sharpe receiving no answer to his knock walked straight into the parlour the room was dark save for the smouldering glow of the fire and it was some time before he discovered rosalies figure huddled up in eliass chair,0
why what be to do he inquired stooping over her,0
oh mr sharpe returned she with a strangled sob i have had such a dayi have been so insulted oh how shall i ever forget it what can i have done to bring about such a thing,0
come cried the farmer much alarmed whatever is it my dear out wi it and lets have some light to see ourselves by,0
with that he seized the poker and stirred the logs on the hearth until they flared up with a brightness almost painful to rosalies aching eyes he saw the traces of tears upon her flushed face and his concern increased,0
i heard ye was in trouble again he said and i thought id look inthem cheeses as yeve been amaking of ever since midsummer is back on your hands they tell me,0
yes said rosalie faintly there are piles and piles of them in the dairy and mr hardy wrote a most illnatured letter about them and everyone in the place will think me a fool but it is nt that i mind so muchi shall sell those cheeses somewhere i suppose and i know mr hardy only sent them back out of spite because i would nt marry john,0
ah put in isaac interested john hardy axed ye did he and you would nt have en,0
well mrs f said isaac leaning forward in his chair and speaking solemnly ye mid ha done worse nor take him t is in my mind he went on emphatically as soon or late yell have to take a second but tell me what was it as upset ye so much today,0
i am almost ashamed to say it sam belbinyou know sam that common lad that i made cowman out of pure kindness and because i thought him faithfulhehethat lout has actually dared to make love to me,0
are you not amazed did you ever hear of such impudence he dared to call me my dear and he seemed to think that i his mistress had actually encouraged him he said something about my dropping a hint but i soon let him see what i thought of him i packed him off on the moment,0
did ye said isaac well my deari beg pardonmrs fiander i should say,0
oh of course she put in quickly i dont mind your saying my deart is a very different matter,0
well as i was asayin pursued the farmer ignoring these niceties i baint altogether so very much surprised ive aheard some queer talk about you and sam belbinonly this very day ive aheard queer talkand to say the truth that were the reason why i looked in this arternooni thought it best not to wait till sunday im not one to meddle but i thought it only kind to let ye know what folks in the village be sayin,0
mr sharpeand her eyes positively blazeddo you mean to tell me that people know me so little as to gossip about me and that low fellow,0
ah my dear cried isaac catching the infection of her excitement theres no knowing what folks do saythey be ready to believe any scandelious thing why bithey did actually tell me t is common talk o the village as you and me be agoin to make a match of it,0
rosalie who had been leaning forward in her chair suddenly sank back she drew a long breath and then said in a very small voice,0
well isaac i believe it will have to come to that,0
not even sam belbin withering under his mistresss scornful gaze had stared at her with such blank dismay as that now perceptible on farmer sharpes face,0
rosalie covered her own with both hands but presently dropped them again,0
everything points to it she said firmly you see yourself things cannot go on as they are i find i cant manage the men,0
here her voice broke but she pursued after a minute even the work which i am competent to undertake has not succeeded elias would be sorely grieved to see everything going wrong like this he who was such a good man of businessalways so regular and particular,0
ah groaned isaac i d low it ud very near break his heart,0
there must be a master here went on rosalie even you were forced to own just now that i ought to marry again,0
ees agreed isaac unwillingly oh ees it ud be a very good thing but i,0
he broke off gazing at her with an expression almost akin to terror,0
do you suppose for a moment she cried with spirit that i would ever consent to put a stranger in my dear eliass place could youyou who have been his friend so long bear to see one of the branston counterjumpers master here i wonder at you isaac sharpe,0
nay now protested the farmer i did nt say i wished no such thing mrs fiander i said t was my opinion as youd be forced to take a second and you might do worse nor think o john hardy,0
whom would you choose then cried she wilson to drink and race away my husbands hardearned money andrew burge perhaps whom you drove out of this house with your own hands or that little ferretfaced samuel crosshed know how to manage a dairyfarm would nt he youd like to see him strutting about and giving orders here i tell you what it is isaac sharpe if you have no respect for dear eliass memory you should be glad that i have,0
who says i have nt respect for liass memory thundered isaac now almost goaded into a fury ive known en a deal longer nor you have widow fiander and theres no one in this world as thought more on him all i says isi baint a marryin manlias knowed i were nt never a marryin man i dont believe added isaac with an emphatic thump on the table i dont believe as if lias were alive hed expect it of me,0
but hes dead you see returned rosalie with a sudden pathetic change of tonehes dead and that is why everything is going wrong i should nt think of making a change myself if i did nt feel it was the only thing to do you loved elias you knew his ways you would carry on the work just as he used to doit would nt be like putting a stranger in his place i would nt do it if i could help it she added sobbing but i think wewe should both try to do our duty by elias,0
isaac visibly moved rolled his eyes towards her and heaved a mighty sigh,0
of course if you put it that way he began and then his courage failed him and be became once more mute,0
it would nt be such a bad thing for you mr sharpe went on rosalie faintly t is a very fine farm and a good business it would be convenient for you to work the two farms together youd have quite a large propertyand this is a very comfortable house,0
ah agreed isaac t is a good house but i have nt no need for two houses im content wi the one where i were born,0
oh but that wont do at all cried rosalie with sudden animation you would have to live herethe object of my marrying you would be that you should live here,0
ive alived in my own house ever sin i were born said the farmer obstinately and when a man weds he takes his wife to live wi him,0
not when the wife has got the best house of the two retorted mrs fiander,0
a man cant live in two houses asserted isaac adding after a pause what would ye have me do with mine then,0
you could put your headman to live in it returned she paying you rent of course or you could let it to somebody elseyou would make money in that way,0
one by one isaacs entrenchments were being carried no resource remained open to him but to capitulate or to take flight he chose the latter alternative,0
t is not a thing as a body can make up his mind to in a hurry he said i must think it over mrs fiander,0
then before she could make the sharp retort which had risen to her lips he had darted to the door,0
as it closed behind him rosalie sprang to her feet and began to pace hastily about the room what had she done she had actually in so many words made an offer of marriage to isaac sharpeand she was not quite sure of being accepted there was the rub elias was an old man yet he had wooed her in her homeless penniless condition with a certain amount of ardour in her widowhood she had been courted doubtless as much on account of her wealth as of her beauty but certainly with no lack of eagerness and now when she had turned with affectionate confidence to this old friend and practically laid herself her good looks and good fortune at his feet he had promised unwillingly to think it over it was not to be enduredshe would send him to the rightabout on his return let his decision be what it might but then came the sickening remembrance of the failures and humiliations which had attended her unassisted enterprises the importunities of distasteful suitorsworst of all the confident leer on sam belbins face great heavens what a miserable fate was hers she dared not so much as trust a servant but he must needs try to take advantage of her unprotected condition,0
the lamp was lit and tea set forth but rosalie left it untasted upon the table she was still pacing restlessly about the room when isaac walked in this time without any preliminary knock,0
he closed the door behind him and advanced towards the young woman his face wearing a benign if somewhat sheepish smile,0
i be come to tell you he said as ive come round to the notion,0
he paused beaming down at her with the air of a man who was making an indubitably pleasant announcement and rosalie who was gifted with a very genuine sense of humour could not for the life of her help laughing,0
ees repeated isaac valiantly ive acomed round to the notion i was alays a bit shy o materimony by reason o the catanddog life as my mother and father did lead but i d low as ive no need to be fearful about you youre made different my dear and yeve been a good wife to lias whats more he went on cheerfully as i was athinkin to myself t is nt same as if i was to go and put myself in the wrong box so to speak by beggin and prayin of ye to have me then ye mid very well cast up at me some day if i was nt satisfied wi the bargain but when a young woman comes and axes a man as a favour to marry her it be a different story baint it,0
if thats the way in which you look at it mr sharpe she said i think we had better give up the idea how dare you she burst out suddenlyhow dare you tell me to my face that i asked you as a favour i am not the kind of person to pray and beseech you you know as well as i do that other people are ready to fall on their knees if i but hold up a finger,0
ah a good few of them are agreed isaac dispassionately but ye dont want em ye see well and at the first go off when i was took by surprise so to speak i thought i did nt want you not as ive any personal objections to you he added handsomely but because i never reckoned on changing my state but now as ive athought it over im agreeable my dear,0
rosalie remained silent her eyes downcast her hands nervously clasping and unclasping each other,0
im willin he went on to do my dooty by lias and my dooty by you rosalie youve been a good wife to he and yell be the same to me ive no doubt,0
he paused passing his hand meditatively over his grizzled locks and probably comforting himself with the reflection that in this case at least there would be no need to supply himself with such a box as that so often dolefully shown to him by his father,0
i want to do my duty by elias said the poor young widow at last in a choked voice but i dont want you to sacrifice yourself since you feel it is a sacrifice if you hate me so much dont marry me isaac she added passionately,0
lard my dear who ever said i hated ee far from it i do like ee very much ive liked ee from the first lias knowed i liked ee say no more about a sacrifice it baint no sacrifice to speak on i was real upset to see how bad you was agettin on an itll be a comfort to think as i can look arter you and look arter the place you and me was alays the best o friends and well go on bein the best o friends when we are man and wife i cant say no fairer than that,0
he stretched out his large brown palm and rosalie laid her cold fingers in it and the compact was concluded by a silent handshake,0
then isaac who was a practical man pointed out to rosalie that her tea was growing cold and remarked placidly that he would smoke a bit of a pipe by the fire while she partook of it,0
as she approached the table and began tremulously to fill her cup he drew forward a chair and sat down,0
rosalie glanced round at him and started the new era had already begun isaac was sitting in eliass chair,0
mong blooming woods at twilight dim the throstle chants with glee o but the plover sings his evening hymn to the ferny wild so free o wild an free wild an free where the moorland breezes blow,0
lamour nous enlve notre librearbitre on peut choisir ses amitis mais on subit lamour,0
one lovely sparkling april day a man was slowly pushing his bicycle up a certain steep incline which is situated a little way out of dorchester and which is known as yellowham hill,0
the road climbed upwards between woods the banks on either side being surmounted by a dense growth of rhododendrons and gorse the latter in full bloom its brilliant yellow contrasting with the glossy dark leaves of the bushes behind which were already covered with a myriad of buds and the little bronze crooks of the bracken curling upwards through the moss beneath,0
the long spring day wanted yet some hours of its close but already delicious spicy odours came forth from the woods which spoke of falling dew and the birds were making mysterious rustlings in the boughs as though preparing to go to roost,0
the young man paused every now and then to draw a long breath and to look round him with evident delight,0
this is good he said to himself once this is fairylandthe place is full of magic then a sudden change came over his face and he added it is better than fairylandit is home,0
he was a pleasantlooking young fellow with a handsome intelligent face and a tall wellknit figure he had grey eyes very alert and keen in their expression and when he smiled his face lit up in an unexpected and attractive way his complexion was browner than might have been looked for in connection with his hair which was not very dark and he had a certain wideawake air as of one who had seen many men and things,0
he had almost reached the crest of the hill when his glance sweeping appreciatively over the curving bank at the turn of the road rested upon a womans figure amid the tangle of sunlit green and gold which crowned it,0
rosalie fianderwho would be rosalie fiander for some three months longer it having been agreed between her and isaac that their marriage should not take place till her years widowhood was completedhad halted here on her return to branston after a flying businessvisit to dorchester,0
these yellowham woods had been much loved by her during her childhood and she had yielded to the temptation of alighting from the gig to spend a few minutes in what had once been to her a very paradise,0
nigger was placidly cropping the grass at a little distance from her and she had been on her way to reenter the vehicle when she had paused for a last glance round,0
she had marked at first idly then with some interest the figure which was toiling up the hill feeling somewhat embarrassed when she discovered on its nearer approach that she was herself the object of a somewhat unusual scrutiny the grey eyes which looked at her so intently from out of the brown face had a very peculiar mixture of expressions there was curiosity in them and admirationto that she was accustomedbut there was something more a wonder an almost incredulous delight thus might a man look upon the face of a very dear friend whom he had not expected to seethus almost might he meet the sweetheart from whom he had been parted for years,0
as he approached the bank he slackened his pace and presently came to a standstill immediately beneath rosalies pinnacle of mossgrown earth,0
they remained face to face with each other for a moment or two rosalie gazing down fascinated at the mans eyes in which the joyful wonder was growing ever brighter rousing herself at last with an effort and colouring high she turned and hastened along the crest of the bank until she came to the gig descended rapidly gathered up the reins and mounted into the vehicle,0
seeing that the stranger though he had begun to walk slowly on continued to watch her and being besides annoyed and confused at her own temporary embarrassment she jerked the reins somewhat sharply and touched up nigger with the whip the astonished animal unaccustomed to such treatment started off at a brisk pace and the gig rattled down the steep incline with a speed which would have filled its late owner with horror,0
the disaster which he would certainly have prophesied was not long in coming niggers legs were not quite on a par with his mettle and presently stumbling over a loose stone he was unable to recover himself and dropped fairly and squarely on both knees,0
he was up in an instant but rosalie jumping out of the cart and running to his head uttered a cry of anguish through the white patches of dust which testified to niggers misfortune she saw blood trickling a moment later rapid footsteps were heard descending the hill and the bicyclist came to her assistance,0
bending forward he carefully examined niggers knees and then turned to rosalie the curious expression which had so puzzled and annoyed her having completely vanished and given place to one of respectful concern,0
dont be frightened he said it is not muchbarely skindeepi doubt if there will be any marks,0
he has never been down before said she tearfully poor nigger good old fellow i should nt have driven you so fast down the hill,0
his legs should be attended to at once said the stranger practically have you far to go,0
branston he echoed i am going there myself tomorrow or rather i am going to a place about a mile this side of it,0
well i too stop a little this side of the town said rosalie but poor nigger will never get so far what am i to do i must get home tonight,0
there is a village a mile or so from here observed the young man i think your best plan would be to leave the horse at the inn there they would probably lend you another to take you home if you will get into the trap i will lead the horse slowly back,0
oh no i will walk cried rosalie i can lead him myself she added diffidently i dont like to take you out of your waybesides you have your bicycle i suppose you are going to dorchester,0
i can go to dorchester any time returned he t is merely a fancy of mine that takes me there ive a wish to see the old place again having been away from it for ten years but i am really on my way to visit my uncle if you know branston i dare say you have met him he lives near littlecomb village at a place called the down farm,0
mr isaac sharpe ejaculated rosalie indeed i do know him i live next door to him,0
she broke off not deeming it necessary to disclose on so short an acquaintance her peculiar relations with the person in question,0
good cried the young man gaily it is strange our meeting like this i am richard marshall his nephew you live next door to him you say he added with a puzzled look then you must beyou are,0
i am mrs fiander returned she you remember elias fiander of littlecomb farm,0
of course i do and i used to know his wife,0
oh you have been so long away that a great many changes have taken place i was elias fianders third wife,0
yes said rosalie blushing she knew not why my dear husband died last july,0
the look of blank dismay which had overspread the young mans face gave way to an expression of relief but he made no reply,0
rosalie took hold of the nearest rein turned nigger round and began to lead him slowly up the hill again,0
i can really manage quite well she said somewhat stiffly,0
i must see you out of your difficulties returned the other with quiet determination and he too began to retrace his steps pausing a moment at the crest of the hill to repossess himself of his bicycle which he had left propped against the bank,0
i will ride on to the village he said and make arrangements about leaving your horse there and getting a fresh one it will save time and there is none to spare if you want to get home before dusk,0
he raised his cap mounted and disappeared before rosalie had time to protest,0
indeed she was glad enough of richard marshalls helpful company when she presently arrived at the black horse inn where in spite of the framed poetical effusion which hung beneath the sign and which testified to the merits of the establishment there was some difficulty in procuring accommodation and attention for poor nigger and even greater in finding a substitute in fact the only animal available proved to be a huge rawboned threeyearold who was with great difficulty persuaded to enter the shafts of the gig and who when harnessed tilted up the vehicle in such a peculiar manner that rosalie shrank back in alarm,0
he does nt look safe she faltered and im quite sure that boy is nt capable of driving him i have been shaken by the fright i suppose for i feel quite unnerved,0
i will drive you said richard with decision waving aside the lad who had been appointed charioteer and who now began to assert his perfect competence to perform the task i guess i can manage most things in the way of horseflesh and in any case i intended to go to my uncles tomorrow,0
oh no i could nt think rosalie was beginning when he interrupted her eagerly,0
nothing will be easier i assure you my bag is here strapped on to my bicycle i meant to take my uncle by surprisehe does nt know i am in england you can send back the horse tomorroweven if you took the lad it would be difficult for him to return tonight my bicycle can stay here until i send for it or fetch it perhaps i had better get in first mrs fiander to keep this wild animal quiet while you get up hand over the reins herethats it hold on by his head till the lady mounts put that machine of mine in a dry place will you now then mrs fiander give me your hand whoa boy steady there we arelet go,0
he laid the whip lightly on the animals back and they were off before rosalie had had time to protest or to demur,0
the long legs of the threeyearold covered the ground in a marvellous manner and with that tall masterful figure by her side she could feel no fear indeed the sensation of swinging along through the brisk air was pleasant enough though she felt a little uncomfortable at the thought of the astonishment which her arrival in such company would produce at home and she was moreover not quite certain if she relished being thus peremptorily taken possession of by the newcomer rosalie was used to think and act for herself and it was quite a new experience to her to have her will gainsaid and her objections overborne even in her own interests but after all the man was isaacs nephew and no one could find fault with her for accepting his assistance in a few months time she would be his auntperhaps he would then allow her wishes to have more weight she smiled to herself as she glanced up at himwhat would he say if she told him the relationship which he would shortly bear to her he would be her nephew how ridiculous it seemed he must be some years older than she was there were firm lines in that brown face and the hands looked capable and strong as if they had accomplished plenty of work,0
when they reached yellowham hill once more and began to descend at a foots pace richard broke silence,0
i have seen and done a good many things in the course of my travels but i have never come across so beautiful a spot as this and none of my adventures have been so curious as the one which introduced me to you,0
really said rosalie drily i cannot see that there was anything so very extraordinary in it even if nigger had not had this accident we should have been certain to meet while you are staying at mr sharpes,0
i wonder said the young man speaking half to himself and half to heri wonder if i should have preferred to meet you first in your own fieldsin a cornfield but the corn of course will not be ripe for months to come no on the whole i am content i said to myself when i was climbing the hill there is magic in this place and i felt it was home,0
i dont know what you mean said rosalie what can it matter where one first meets a new acquaintance and why should it be in a cornfield,0
but surely you were not in england last harvest time she cried what are you talking about you have only just said that you would like to have met me first in a cornfield which proveswhat is truethat you have never seen me before,0
i have seen you before he murmured in a low voice,0
nonsense nonsense she cried sharply you must have dreamt it,0
yesi did dreamabout you he owned glancing at her and once more that curious look of wondering joy stole over his face,0
rosalie drew a little away from him in a displeasure which he was quick to observe,0
i will explain some day he said looking down at her with a smile which disarmed her and then having reached the bottom of the hill he chirruped to the horse and they sped along once more at an exhilarating pace,0
byandby he began to talk about his uncle speaking of him with such evident affection that the heart of the future mrs sharpe warmed to him her grateful regard for isaac had increased during their four months betrothal indeed it could not have been otherwise he was so placid and goodnatured and obliging moreover he took a lot of trouble off her hands for he had assumed the management of the farm immediately after their engagement no one could cavil at this arrangement it was natural that the man who was so shortly to be master should at once take over the control of affairs even the gossips of the neighbourhood could make no illnatured comments one and all indeed agreeing that it was pretty behaviour on the part of the widow fiander to postpone the wedding till after the year was out,0
so rosalie listened well pleased while richard spoke of isaacs past generosity to him and his mother of the high esteem in which he held him and of his desire to spend a few weeks in his company before going out into the world afresh,0
perhaps i ought to tell him that i am going to marry his uncle thought rosalie and then she dismissed the notion let isaac make the announcement himself she felt rather shy about itand possibly richard marshall might not like the idea,0
she began to question him instead anent his past achievements and future prospects and heard with astonishment and concern that the young man had not only failed to make his fortune in the distant lands he had visited but had come back in some ways poorer than he had set out,0
only in some things though he said i reckon i am richer on the whole,0
how are you poorer and how are you richer queried rosalie,0
i am poorer in pocket my uncle sent me out with a nice little sum to start me in life ah as i tell you hes a firstrate old chap he could nt have done more for me if i had been his son well thats gone long ago but i have come back richer all the samerich in experience for one thing i have seen a lot and learnt a lot i educated myself out there in more ways than one dear old dorset holds a very fine place on the map of england yet t is but a tiny corner of the world after all,0
as she listened there came to rosalie a sudden inexplicable envy she had never been out of her native countyshe had never wanted to travel beyond its borders but for a moment the thought struck her that it might be a fine and desirable thing to see the world,0
i wonder she said tartly for her irritation at this discovery recoiled on its unsuspicious causei wonder mr marshall you should care to come back to dorset since you have such a poor opinion of it why did nt you settle out there,0
out where he inquired with a smile i have tried to settle in a good many places i was in a newspaper office in new yorkit was while i was there that i did most in the way of educating myselfand then i went to san francisco and then to texas ive been pretty well over the states in fact and ive been to mexico and brazil and canada i might have done well in several places if i could have made up my mind to stick to the job in handbut i could nt something was drawing me all the timedrawing me back to englanddrawing me home so that at last i felt i must come back,0
and what will you do now she inquired with curiosity,0
oh he cried drawing a deep breath i must work on a farm the love for farmwork is in my blood i believe i want the smell of the freshturned earth i want my arms to be tired heaving the sheaves into the waggons i want to lead out the horses early in the morning into the dewy fieldsi want oh many things,0
rosalie considered him wonderingly these things were done around her every day as a matter of course but how curiously the man spoke of them how unaccountable was that longing of which he spoke she had never seen anyone the least like him and now that the conversation had drifted away from herself she felt a real pleasure and interest in listening to his talk as they drove onward through the gathering twilight she too was moved to talk and was charmed by his quick understanding and ready response her own wits were quick enough but she had fallen into the habit of keeping her opinions on abstract subjects to herself the concrete was all that the people with whom she associated were capable of discussing and indeed they had not much to say on any matter at any time this young bright personality was something so absolutely new to her his point of view so original and vigorous and his sympathy so magnetic that rosalie enjoyed her adventure as she had never enjoyed anything in her life before her eyes shone her cheeks flushed her merry laugh rang out she felt that she too was young and lighthearted and that life and youth and gay companionship made a very delightful combination,0
as they drew near their destination a sudden silence fell between them and presently richard broke it speaking in a soft and altered tone,0
how familiar the country grows even in the dark i recognise a friend at every turn is not that your house yonder where the lights are glimmering,0
the cornfield where i saw you lies just to the right of it,0
i wish you would not talk in riddles said rosalie breathing rather quickly through the dusk he could see the wrathful fire in her eyes,0
do not be angry he said quickly i meant to tell you another time when i had come to know you better but after all why should i not tell you now i saw a picture of you in london i stayed a day or two there on my way through from liverpooli had some business to do for a friend in new yorkand i went to the academy and there in the very first room i saw your picture,0
my picture ejaculated she it must have been the one that london gentleman said he would paint,0
yes it was youyou yourself and you were lying in a cornfield under a shock of wheat and the corner of your house could just be seen in the distance and some of the men were reaping a little way offbut you were fast asleep,0
rosalies heart was thumping in a most unusual way and her breath came so pantingly that she did not trust herself to speak,0
t was a big picture he said full of sunshine and when i saw itthe whole thingthe great field stretching away and the men working and the quiet old house in the distance and the girl sleeping so placidlyit was all so glowing and yet so peaceful and homelike that my heart went out to it thats dorset i said and i believe i criedi know i felt as if i could cry after all those years of wandering to find when i thought myself all alone in a great strange city that piece of home smiling at onei tell you it made one feel queer,0
rosalie remained silent angry with herself for the agitation which had taken possession of her,0
so you see i was not quite so far wrong in saying that todays meeting was a very strange one the first instant my eyes fell upon you i recognised you,0
she felt she must say something but her voice sounded husky and quite unlike itself when she spoke,0
it certainly was odd that we should come across each other near dorchester it would of course have been quite natural if you had recognised me when you came to your uncles,0
i thought you would have been more interested in my story he said reproachfully after a pause,0
i ami am very much interested i think it a very funny story,0
funny he repeated and then relapsed into silence which remained unbroken until they turned in at rosalies gate,0
a thousand thorns and briers and stings i have in my poor breast yet neer can see that salve which brings my passion any rest,0
well my boy i be main glad you be come back there baint no place like home be there,0
as isaac sharpe repeated these words for the twentieth time since his nephews arrival he beamed affectionately upon him through the fragrant steam of the bowl of punch specially brewed in his honour and then leaning back in his chair sighed and shook his head,0
ye be wonderful like your mother richard he said and sighed again and groaned and took another sip of punch blinking the while partly from the strength of the decoction and partly because he was overcome by emotion,0
richard sitting opposite to him stretched out his legs luxuriously to the warmth of the crackling wood fire and removing his pipe from his lips gazed contentedly round the familiar kitchen which was now looking its best in the homely radiance,0
it is good to come back to the dear old place and to find everything exactly the same as ever you dont seem to have grown a day older uncle isaacnothing is changed i cant tell you how delightful that is i had been tormenting myself during the journey with fancying i should find things alteredbut thank heaven they are not,0
he glanced brightly at the broad rubicund face opposite to him and took his glass from the table,0
your health uncle may you live a thousand years and may you be the same at the end of them,0
he half emptied his glass and set it down with a cheery laugh,0
isaac drank slowly from his peering meanwhile at his nephew over the rim,0
thank you my lad he said replacing it on the table at last im obliged to you richard t is kindly meant but changes d ye seehere he paused and coughedchanges richard is what must be looked for in this here world,0
his colour always sufficiently ruddy was now so much heightened and his face assumed so curiously solemn an expression that richard paused with his pipe halfway to his lips and stared at him with amazement and gathering alarm,0
whats the matter he said anxiously are nt you feeling well youre looking firstrate,0
never felt better in my life rejoined his uncle in sepulchral tones,0
come thats all right you quite frightened me what do you mean by talking about changes,0
isaac took a gulp from his tumbler and fixed his round eyes dismally on the young man,0
there may be sich things as changes for the better he remarked still in his deepest bass,0
dont believe in em cried richard gaily dont tell me youre going to turn methody or salvationist or anything of that kind i like you as you areand i dont want you to be any better,0
dear heart alive what notions the chap d take in his head ejaculated the farmer relaxing into a smile nay now i never thought on sich things but therell be a change in this here house for all that richard i be agoinhere isaac leaned forward with a hand on either knee and fixed his eyes earnestly almost tragically on his nephewi be agoin richard for to change my state,0
he slowly resumed an upright position drawing in his breath through dilated nostrils,0
i be agoin richard he continued observing the others blank and uncomprehending starei be agoin to get married,0
bless me exclaimed richard taken aback for a moment then rising from his chair he stepped up to his uncle and slapped him heartily on the back well done he cried well done i give you joy upon my life i did nt think you had so much go in youyoure a splendid old chap,0
thank ee said isaac without much enthusiasm im glad youre not agen it,0
why should i be against it returned richard hilariously im a little surprised because i did nt think that was in your line but after all marry in haste and repent at leisure the saying goesyour case is the reverse you have taken your time about marrying so perhaps it will be all the better for you,0
i hope so im sure said the bridegroomelect dolefully adding as richard still laughing resumed his seat i thought id best tell ee at once as there was goin to be a change,0
well well a change for the better as you say cried the other therell be two to welcome me when i pay the down farm a visit instead of one i shall find a jolly old aunt as well as a jolly old uncle,0
isaac took his pipe out of his mouth with a perturbed expression,0
no noof course not neither are you for that matter may she be an evergreen like yourself,0
thank ee richard thank ee im glad as you approve o my thinking on matrimony,0
why matrimonys the best thing going said richard still gaily yet with an undercurrent of something curiously like tenderness every grief is lessened by half and every joy is doubled always a bright cheery face at the fireside always a kind true hand in yoursa womans wit to point out where the man has been at fault,0
ah interrupted his uncle with a groan they be willin enough to do that,0
always ready to comfort you when you are in trouble went on the young man without heeding him ready to advise you when you are in a difficultythe best of companions the most faithful of friends the kindest of helpmatesthats a wife,0
the farmer was gazing across at him with bewilderment mixed with delight,0
well said richardvery well said ye be wonderful quick wi your tongue if thats the way ye feel about wedlock you ought to be lookin out for a wife o your own,0
nonsense uncle isaac why i have nt a penny i shall have hard work to keep myself to begin with,0
come come we mid be able to manage summat ive a notion in my head ye be agoin to take up farmwork agen ye tell me well an as i says to you why not work on the farm where ye was brought up and why not take wage from your own flesh and blood instead of lookin to strangers for t,0
theres no one i should like to work for better than you uncle isaacyou know that,0
i do know it richard i d know it very well but says you to me i must have somewheres to live says you,0
no i dont uncle isaac i say nothing of the kind put in the young man hastily if you intended to remain a bachelor it would be a different matter but,0
im not axing you to live wi me returned isaac throwing out his hand in a lordly manner if i was agoin to keep single it ud come natral enough but my new missuswell t is this way she have got a house of her own and shes anxious for me to live over there along o her,0
ees i were agen it at first but i come round to it arter so i reckoned to let this here house to somebodyone of the men praps but now has youve acomed back richard my boy there baint nobody id like to see livin here so much as yourself my notion ud be for you to settle down wi a wife to do for you and keep the place tidy and work this here farm under me my hands ull be pretty full and ill be glad o your help shes got a biggish place to manage and ill be glad to think as theres somebody here as i can rely on well what do you say,0
what do i say cried richard stammering with joy what can i say i dont know how to thank you,0
well said the farmer jovially and now what about the missus ave ee got your eye on anyone as ud suit,0
why began richard eagerly he paused and then continued laughingly you must give me a little time you know ive only been a few days in england,0
thats true im glad to think my lad as you dont want to take a wife from abroad nay dont ye go travellin for a wife take my word for t the best is often to be picked up close at hand not always though he continued reflectively poor elias fianderye mind lias fiander he went travellin all the way to dorchester to buy a turmithoin machine and it was there nigh upon eighteen miles off as he come across his last missus but you know her he went on with animationaye now as i call it to mind you were atellin me how you drove her back today ah sure so ye did,0

ah so ye did twere funny how you come across her i be pleased to think as yeve met she were a good missus to eliasshe were indeedand a good missus to one man is like to be a good one to another,0
richard caught his breath and leaned forward his face was flushed his eyes shining,0
why do you say this to me now he said eagerly,0
his uncle removed his pipe from his mouth took a sip of punch and then looked at him solemnly,0
because richard my boy t is but natral i should talk of her seein as we be goin to be man an wife so soon,0
what do you mean cried richard almost violently what are you talking about,0
why returned isaac raising his voice to a kind of mild roar you have nt been listenin to me ive been atalkin about mrs fianderliass widow i be agoin to get married to she,0
you exclaimed his nephew in the same loud fierce tone,0
ees bellowed farmer sharpe have nt i been atellin ye this hour and more did nt i say i were agoin to change my state and did nt i tell ee shed a house of her own and wanted me to live over there along of her but your brains was woolgatherinill lay a shillin you was athinkin o your own young woman cried isaac with a roar of laughter stretching forward a long arm that he might give his nephew a facetious dig on the nearest available portion of his person,0
youre a sly dog uncle isaac he said ah youre a cunning old chapyouve got your wits about you if mine have gone astray yes and youve very good taste tooyouve picked out the greatest beauty in dorset,0
except your young woman eh put in isaac with a chuckle and another dig,0
except my young woman of course agreed richard laughing again with that odd contortion of the face but i have nt found her yet you know,0
my weddinday is fixed for the end o july said his uncle ruminatively youll have to look out for your missus afore that time i doubt as you and bithey ud scarce get on so very wellim used to her you see but shes a cranky old body and it ud never do for ye to settle down wiout a woman o some kind to do for ee we might ha the two weddins same day id like to know as you was settled when i have to shift,0
thank you kindly uncle youve always been like a father to me and i cant tell you how grateful i am to you for the welcome youve given me and for wanting to do so much for me but i dont know about settling down after allive been a rover so long you see ii might nt be able to stick to it and then you might be disappointed,0
stuff an nonsense ill not hear o no objections why richard you never were one to blow hot one minute and cold the next it baint half an hour since you said there was naught you wished for so much as to take up farmwork again and live on the old placedid nt ee,0
but nothin youre awoolgatherinthats it your thoughts is awanderin off to the new missus,0
is not that to be expected returned his nephew idly,0
resting his elbows on his knees and his chin in his hands he leaned forward gazing thoughtfully into the fire,0
i have nt got over my surprise at your piece of news yet he said after a pause i thought you so determined a bachelor,0
so i thought myself put in isaac with a nod,0
and thenfrom what ive seen of mrs fiander i should never have imagined that she would be the wife you would choose when you did make up your mind to take one,0
shes so youngforty years younger than you i should think,0
then she is so beautifulso full of life and spirit and dash i cant imagine how you came to think of her,0
there was a pause during which isaac meditatively smoked and rubbed his knees,0
well he said at last i did nt exactly think of it myself ye seebut i could nt someways find it in my heart to say no,0
to say what cried the young man dropping his hands and whisking round in his chair,0
isaac gazed at him mildly and continued to polish his corduroys,0
to say no he repeated slightly uplifting his voice and speaking very slowly and distinctly i say i could nt find it i my eart tosaynowhen she axed me,0
she asked you do you mean to say that the proposal came from her,0
t war nt very likely it ud ha come fro me he remarked dispassionately as i told her at the time i never was a marryin man,0
a silence ensued during which richard vainly endeavoured to readjust his ideas at length he said faintly,0
she said returned farmer sharpe stolidly that it would nt be a bad thing for met is a fine farm says she and a good business you could easy work the two farms together says she,0
richard gazed at his uncle with starting eyes and a dropping jaw,0
but why in the name of fortune he ejaculated i could understand her marrying againbut why you,0
she knowed id work the farm right d ye see things was goin wrong all round and she knowed i understood the work ah i told her myself at the time that she ought to look out for a younger man but she says i dont want no counterjumpers says shemeanin the branston folks ah there were a good few after her but she did nt fancy none o them she thought some was arter the money and none o them knowed anythin about dairyfarmin,0
in fact struck in richard rising from his chair and beginning to pace hastily about the room she has proved herself to be a most practical woman you wont make away with her moneyyou wont allow mismanagement of the business,0
jist so agreed his uncle sucking vigorously at his partially extinguished pipe,0
richard continued to walk about the room and presently paused opposite the hearth,0
did she make an offer to elias fiander too he inquired sharply,0
isaac removed his pipe and stared up at him the idea was evidently presented to him for the first time,0
he never telled me so he said it were made up in a hurry to be sure lias had nt no notion o sich a thing when he started off from here he went arter a turniphoer arter her granfers death they sold en up poor old chap and rosaliethats mrs fianderhad nt nowhere to go,0
but i think pursued the farmer averting his eyes from his nephews face and gazing stolidly at the firei think twas lias as axed her ees now i can mind he told me so at the time me wantin a wife so bad says he and her bein such a good hand at the dairywork i thought id make sure o her he says,0
she told him i suppose that she was a good hand at dairywork commented marshall yes i understand the matter now she is as i say a practical woman,0
she isshe is agreed farmer sharpe warmly she be a wonderful good manager manys the time ive said that ah i reckon i can say im in luck,0
richard murmured something inarticulate and returned to his chair relighting his pipe and beginning to smoke without further remark on the opposite side of the hearth isaac ruminated contentedly without appearing to notice his nephews preoccupation and tumblers and pipes were emptied in almost unbroken silence,0
when richard sought his room that nightthe familiar little atticroom which had been his in childhoodhis first act after a cursory glance of recognition and approval was to set down his candle on the little deal table and to draw carefully from his pocket a large envelope opening this he took out a print evidently cut from some illustrated paper or collection of pictures of the year holding it close to the light he looked at it intently underneath were the words a sleeping beauty followed by the artists name the picture represented a cornfield with a large shock of sheaves to the front beneath which lay the outstretched figure of a girl asleep even in this rough reproduction a certain likeness to rosalie was discernible and richards fancy supplied the rest indeed as he gazed he contemplated not only the glowing and highlyfinished work of art which had haunted him persistently since he had first beheld it but the vision of that afternoonthe exquisite face the lithe graceful form which had suddenly appeared to him against its background of bloom and sunlit green he seemed to hear again the blithe young voice which had thrilled him as it prattled at his side he seemed to see the large eyes lifted a little shyly to his and then modestly dropped because of his too evident admiration,0
he had deemed these things the outward indication of absolute womanly perfection his young imagination fired by the unexpected meeting with rosalie and further stimulated by his uncles chance remarks had created a marvellous romance before isaac had pronounced the name of his own future bride now the golden glow had vanished all was flat and dull and grey and what was worse he knew his ideal to have been delusive young bloom and beauty and fascination meant nothingrosalie fiander was a calculating mercenary woman devoid even of feminine reticence not content with setting her capodious phraseat the man whom she considered best likely to protect her interests she had actually offered herself to him haggled over the prospective bargain weighed with him the gains which must accrue to both when she was little more than a child she had angled for old elias fiander well she was homeless and penniless then and might from her extreme youth be supposed to know no better but now in the ripeness of her womanhood with wealth liberty all that she could desire at her command she must needs sell herself again pah such a nature must positively be depraved,0
with an impetuous movement he held the paper over the candle but as suddenly snatched it away again extinguishing the flame with his finger and thumb and rubbing the burnt edge ruefully,0
this at least is a thing of beauty he said why destroy it,0
then hastily restoring the print to its wrapper and thrusting it into his pocket again he muttered i wish i had never seen her,0
come come away or let me go must i here stay troth lady no,0
isaac was somewhat disappointed at his nephews lack of enthusiasm over a project which had at first seemed to take his fancy so much talk as he might about richards future and his own desire that he should pass the remainder of his days on the down farm he could extract nothing from the young man but vague expressions of gratitude and a doubtful promise to think the matter over,0
im goin up yonder to fianders remarked isaac after breakfast theres a little matter there as i must see to ye mid as well step up along wi me richard,0
i was thinking of taking a stroll round this place rejoined richard,0
why whats all your hurry ye may as well wait till i am ready to go wi ye ill not be above two or three minutes at littlecomb and then we mid walk round together besides yell be wantin to pay your respects to mrs fiander wont ye arter drivin her from dorchester yesterdayand her thats goin to be your aunt,0
to be sure i must keep on good terms with my aunt must nt i else perhaps she wont make me welcome when i come to see you,0
no fear o thatshell make ee welcome enough she alays behaved uncommon civil and respectful to i in liass time ah sure that she did,0
perhaps she wont be pleased at my calling so early,0
early dear heart alive you dont know that woman richard shes astir soon arter four in the morning and she has her maids afoot afore that aye and the men knows if they comes late theyll get fined ah she be a wonderful manager,0
then what in the name of wonder said richard to himself as he followed the portly white figure across the yard and over the downswhat in the name of wonder can she want with you,0
despite farmer sharpes protest most people would have considered the hour at which they betook themselves to call at littlecomb farm a sufficiently early one the dew lay thick and sparkling upon the short herbage of the downs and the air was still sharp and keen a lark was circling over their heads its jubilant notes piercing richards heart with an odd sense of pain what was this heaviness which had come upon him and which even the brisk walk through the exhilarating air and the delightfully familiar scents and sounds and sights could not drive away,0
now they had entered rosalies demesne these wide fields were hers yonder were her cattle grazing by the river and here peeping through the trees and compassed about by a goodly array of stacks was her house with its bodyguard of farmbuildings,0
richard who had not spoken much throughout the walk became altogether silent as he crossed the wellkept yard and even lagged behind when his uncle approached the open milkhouse door through this open door the sound of female voices could be heard raised one in voluble excuse another whose tone richard recognised with a little shiver of inexplicable anguish in vituperation but isaac sharpe boldly advanced into the building and beckoned to him to follow,0
why whats the matter here he inquired goodhumouredly fine mornin mrs f ive brought my nevvy to see ye,0
hell find us rather in a mess im afraid returned rosalies clear voice still with a distinct note of sharpness in it but i am very glad he has come i want to thank him for his kindness to me yesterday,0
peering over his uncle richard descried the mistress of the establishment stooping over the large cheesevat already alluded to one white arm bare almost to the shoulder vigorously kneading and stirring a huge mass of curds her buff print dress appeared to imprison the sunshine and attitude and movement alike showed off her supple figure to the very best advantage,0
most lovers thought the young man would have been unable to resist the temptation of putting an arm about that inviting waist for the morning greetingthe arm of the future husband had surely a right to be there but isaac sharpe stood bluff and square in the doorway his hands in his pockets his hat on his head,0
youll excuse my shaking hands said rosalie looking up with eyes in which the angry light still lingered and a puckered brow everything is upset and i cant leave the curds for a minute indeed as it is i fancy the whole of this batch will be good for nothing,0
a hitherto imperceptible dimple peeped out near her lips when she spokesuch red ripe lips such a bewitching dimple isaac however merely thrust his hands a little deeper into his pockets and again inquired with increased concern,0
this morning i happened to be late said rosalie uplifting her voice evidently for the benefit of the culprit jane who had suddenly melted into tears a fact which was betrayed by her heaving shoulders as she stood with her back to the visitors,0
i happened to be a little late repeated rosalie severely so i desired one of the maidshere jane sniffed deprecatinglyto start work without me and when i came down what do you think i actually found the careless girl pouring the rennet in out of the bottle,0
tch tch tch commented the farmer clicking his tongue commiseratingly,0
there were nt but a few spoonfuls left explained jane almost inarticulately,0
how could you possibly tell how many were left retorted her mistress with increased acerbity you know how particular i always am to measure it out drop for drop almosta spoonful too much may make all the differenceparticularly at this time of year i call it downright wicked of you to run the risk of spoiling the whole vatful there are a hundred and fifty gallons of milk in this vatit should make nearly a hundredweight of cheese and just because you are so idle and careless it may all go to waste,0
jane turned her pretty tearbedabbled face over her shoulder and inconsequently and incoherently protested that she always did her best then with a gasp and a moan she darted past the group in the doorway and ran round the house,0
richard looked after her with a disgusted air and then his glance reverted to mrs fiander whose beautiful round arm was still embedded in curds and whose face a little paler than its wont continued to be full of ire what could this trifling mistake matter after all to such a rich woman a woman who would soon be richer still besides being coldblooded and selfinterested she was evidently miserly she was moreover distinctly badtempered his imagination already warped by the revulsion of feeling consequent on his uncles disclosures was ready to take alarm at every trivial detail rosalies pallor and the slightly drawn look on her faceboth due in reality to a sleepless night resulting from an unaccountable perturbation of mindwere immediately attributed to an acute and unreasonable disappointment over an insignificant money loss the eyes which had gazed on rosalie so ardently yesterday were now busily tracing lines of fancied meanness in her face those frowning brows surely revealed the shrew the compressed lips spoke of parsimony when that lovely colour faded and those clearcut features had become coarsened by age and selfimposed toil what would remain none of that beauty of soul which he had thought to find there,0
well well remarked isaac placidly these accidents will happen but i would nt advise ee to be cast down by em these here curds d seem to be asettin all right i know how t is wi young folks a body has to stand over them all the time why when we be ashearin i d scarce dare go in for a bit o dinner for fear o findin them poor ewes snipped to pieces when i come back,0
rosalie jerked the mass of curds up with additional impetuosity but made no reply,0
my nevvy pursued isaac thought hed like to drop in an pay his respects to ee my dear an inquire how you was afeelin arter the accident yesterday,0
here he nudged richard as a tacit reproach for his muteness,0
i hope said the young man formally that you are none the worse for the shock mrs fiander,0
the blue eyes shot up an inquiring glance and the industrious arm paused for a moment what was the meaning of this altered tone and why was the gaze now bent on her fraught with such cold disapproval they had parted like old friends and she had looked forward more than she knew to their next meeting,0
thank you she returned in a tone almost as frigid as richards own my nerves are not easily upset,0
she believed the statement to be true yet the equilibrium of her system was at that moment if she had but realised it very seriously disturbed,0
i sent james bundy to look after him he may not be fit to move for a day or two,0
ah he were a good beast remarked the farmer t is a pity ye did let en slip t was wi drivin fast downhill my nevvy here d tell me an thats what heve never been used to ye should have druv en more carefully my dear,0
rosalie thought of the cause of her unusual haste on the previous day it was her anxiety to escape from the too evident admiration of the grey eyes which were now bent on her with so different an expression the memory confused her the contrast stung her she answered sharply and with assumed indifference,0
one cannot crawl down every slope to suit the convenience of a wornout animal,0
he baint wornout though returned her future husband who invariably took things literally nay i should say hed last a good few years yet though he be past ard work lias alays used en gentle t is wonderful how far thatll go both with man an beast fair an soft do go far in a day the sayin goes fair an softah t is trew t is trew,0
rosalie bent her head over the vat in silence her face averted so that her visitors could see only the outline of her cheek the exquisite curves of ear and neck,0
fair and soft muttered richard to himself fair and soft enough to look at but her heart is as the nether millstone,0
his uncle gazed reproachfully at him he was proud of his travelled and booklearned nephew and had eagerly looked forward to the impression he was sure to produce on mrs f who had also been highly educated and was considered an authority on matters appertaining to cultureand he was not showing off at all he was standing there mumchance as stupid as any other body might be he gave him another admonitory nudge and remarked,0
richard thats my nevvy did quite take me by surprise last night i was nt expectin to see en at all to tell the trewth i had no kind o notion o where he mid be he had nt wrotehow long were it since youve awrote me last richard inquired isaac driving home the query with his elbow and again frowning and winking,0
i dont know answered his nephew in muffled tones a long time im afraid but you see you never wrote to me he added with a laugh,0
that be different my boy returned the farmer seriously there was reasons why i did nt write richard i never was a writin man lard noand here he relaxed and uttered a jolly laught is as much as i can do to put my name to a receipt an then bithey d do it for i and i do jist stick my mark under it nay richard i never was one for writing muchnay i was nt,0
he continued to roll his shoulders and to chuckle nay meditatively at intervals but his eyes were meanwhile fixed appealingly upon the face of richard who remained obstinately dumb,0
i suppose now that you are here youll remain some time mr marshall she asked without looking round her voice in consequence sounding nearly as muffled as the young mans own as she bent over her cauldron,0
that depends mrs fiander of course i want to see as much as i can of my uncle but im restless by nature andand i never stay very long in one place,0
there now cried isaac in loud remonstrance what ye be at it again be ye did nt we arguefy enough about it last night ill not take no an so i tell ee yeve acomed home and now ye may bide at home lard i did nt think ye could be sich a voolish chap what need have ye to go travellin the world when ye have a good berth offered ye an them thats alays been your friends ready an anxious to keep ye heres mrs f will tell ee the same as i do wont ee my dear,0
i dont quite understand what it is all about said rosalie pausing in her labours however and straightening herself,0
why t is this way explained the farmer when richard come last night he says to me says he ive been alonging for years an years to get back to the wold place an now says he i d feel as if i could nt settle to naught but the old work farmwork he says well then this here house ull be empty afore very long an moreover says i i shall need to have somebody responsible to look after this place for it stands to reason mrs f as i cant be in two places at one time,0
rosalie endorsed this statement with an inarticulate murmur and he continued,0
well then says i since you want to come back to the wold place an take up the farmwork why not live here and work for i,0
jist what i d say said the farmer indignantly why not first he were quite took wi the notion but arter a bit he did nt seem to relish it now i want to know pursued isaac extending an aggrieved forefinger why dont ee relish it richard,0
suppose you should be disappointed in mesuppose i should nt give you satisfaction said richard hesitatingly,0
pooh nonsense ill let ee know fast enough if ye dont give satisfaction have nt i brought ee up baint he much same as a son to i,0
but ifif i should find i could nt settle then youd be more vexed than if i had nt given in to the plan,0
but why should nt ee settle thats what i want to know ax en that mrs f ax en why he should nt settle hant ee travelled enough,0
yes indeed said rosalie i should think you ought to be glad of a little quiet mr marshall,0
well said cried isaac tell en hell be a fool if he lets my offer slip,0
indeed repeated rosalie gazing in surprise from the heated and excited countenance of the elder man to the inscrutable one of his nephewindeed i think mr marshall would be very unwise if he did not accept it it seems to me entirely to his advantage,0
and of course said richard with a momentary gleam in his steelgrey eyes of course my personal advantage should outweigh every other consideration it is obvious nothing like a womans clear head for solving a difficulty i will take your advice,0
rosalies pretty face wore a look of such absolute bewilderment and she was evidently so much at a loss to account for his sarcastic tone that richard suddenly burst out laughing the cloud lifted from his brow giving place to an expression of frank goodhumour uncle isaac he cried clapping him heartily on the shoulder forgive my chopping and changing so often this time my mind is made up i accept your offer shake hands on it,0
the blackthornflower hath fallen away the blackthornflower that wise men say keeps wild and variable skies as long as it may stay but heres the gorse and heres the whin and here the pearld may appears and poisonweeds of satin skin through every bank prick long green ears to hear the cuckoocries,0
to gather flowers sappho went and homeward she did bring within her lawny continent the treasure of the spring,0
richard marshall drove the plough slowly up the brown slope half turned at the summit halted and having established his horses at a comfortable angle sat down with his back against a tall mossy bank sheltered by a little copse to eat his breakfast,0
he had already partaken of a dew bit shortly after dawn but two or three hours exercise in the brisk morning air had whetted his appetite afresh and he now fell to work on his bread and bacon with the utmost zest and relish,0
the great field all glittering green save for the brown strip which testified to recent labours stretched away for many goodly acres on a lesser slope beneath he could see the roofs of littlecomb farm and its appurtenances but the sight of the amber and ruddy outlines awakened in him now no feeling of repulsion during the past weeks he had laughed himself out of his whilom fancy for the fascinating and disappointing widow he had even taken himself to task somewhat severely for his strictures on that unconscious young woman was it her fault after all that her outer parts belied her real self why had he been so unreasonably angry because she had failed to correspond to the high estimate which he had formed on slight and inadequate premises she was a very beautiful creature and no doubt good enough in her way if she was commonplace and had a sharp eye for the main chance she would make the better wife to a practical farmer he would in all probability get on well enough with her when she became his aunt but meanwhile life was too full of congenial work and evergrowing interest to admit of his wasting time in improving his acquaintance with the future mrs sharpe,0
he had thrown himself into his new pursuits with characteristic energy and found them daily more and more engrossing he possessed a gift not often to be met with in the cultivator of the soila love of nature for her own sakea sympathy with her moods not from the practical but from the poetical standpoint clouds and sunlight frosts and dew meant more to him than to his brothertoiler the very odour of the damp earth the fragrance of the bursting buds in copse and hedgerow of the crushed herbage beneath his feet intoxicated him the homely thud of the horses hoofs as they trod the furrow the ripping up of the green sod as he drove the plough through it the mere consciousness of his own vigour and life and manhood dominating this solitude filled him with a kind of ecstasy this is what i want he had said to himself over and over again that morning this is what i have always wanted,0
he had finished his breakfast now but he permitted himself the luxury of repose for a few moments longer he threw himself back on the bank his head resting on his clasped hands and his eyes gazing up up through the interlacing boughs of the trees outlined now with shifting silver in the morning light through the ethereal leafage still half unfolded up to the heights of delicate blue beyond he had fancied that there was not much breeze this morning yet as he lay thus quiet he could hear a faint rustling in the undergrowth and the occasional crackling of twigsa squirrel perhaps but when was a wood known to be absolutely still besides the incidental noises attending the passage of living thingsflying running creepingthe creaking and swaying of boughs the fluttering of leaves had not such places a mysterious movement and vitality of their own was there not always a stir a whisper in their midst produced by no ostensible cause,0
smiling upwards his head still pillowed on his hands richard was meditating on some halfforgotten page of thoreau which seemed to bear upon this fancy of his when suddenly a womans figure appeared on the crest of the bank close to him and without warning sprang down beside him rosalie fiander with the skirt of her print gown gathered up so as to form a receptacle for the mass of primroses which she had been gathering and the fragrance of which was now wafted to richards nostrilsrosalie fiander with minute dewdrops clinging to her dark hair with morning roses on her cheeks and the morning light shining in her eyesa vision of grace and beauty more captivating even than the glowing pictured rosalie of the cornfield or the stately heroine of yellowham woods,0
richard sat up the colour rushing over his sunburnt face he had divested himself of hat and coat his waistcoat hung loosely open and his shirt was unfastened at the throat for a moment rosalie did not identify him then as he slowly rose to his feet she too blushed,0
i beg your pardon i did not know anyone was here i had a halfhour to spare before breakfast and ran out to pick some primroses this is my wood you know she added hastily i am not trespassing unless when i take a short cut home across your uncles field,0
ploughman richard with his bare brown arms and ruffled head was not at all alarming she scarcely recognised in him the trim severe young man who had called on her ceremoniously a few weeks before still less the mysterious personage who had driven her home from dorchester who had said such strange things and looked at her so oddlyisaac sharpes nephew was just like anybody else after all being blithe of heart this bright spring morning she smiled on him pleasantly and lowering the folds of her gown displayed the primroses,0
are they not lovely i like them better than any other flowerin fact i love them almost the first thing that i can remember is holding on to my mothers finger while she took me up to a bank of primroses afterwards when i grew old enough to pick them for myself oh the delight each spring of finding the first primrose,0
now curiously enough the gay tone and easy manner had the effect of filling richard with wrath the very grace of her attitude the childlike candour of her eyes were to him obnoxious the more so because he could not repress a momentary thrill of admiration he knew how much they were worth he knew the sordid nature beneath this attractive disguise,0
primroses are fine things he said with assumed carelessness you should have picked some before the nineteenth then you would have had a good sale for them,0
but i dont want to sell them cried she her white teeth flashing out as she laughed and the dimples coming and going i picked them for myselfi shall fill every vase in the house primroses should never be sold those you see in the streets look so miserable all huddled together with their dear little faces crushed and faded and even their scent gone it seems a sin to sell primroses,0
yes particularly as i dont suppose they fetch a big price in the market,0
she had gathered up a bunch in one hand and now raised it to her soft cheek,0
somehow the gesture and the smile which accompanied it provoked richard beyond endurance,0
they are pretty little yellow things he said but not worth the attention of practical people there are other yellow things more deserving of admirationrolls of beautiful fresh butter for instance fine round cheesesthe beauty of these is that they can be exchanged for still finer yellow thingsgolden coin mrs fiander that is the only yellow thing really worth thinking about,0
are you so fond of money she asked innocently and once more she laid the dewdrenched flowers caressingly against her cheek how could she look so guileless how had she the face to turn the tables on him thus above all how dared she be so beautiful he had almost succeeded in forgetting his transitory hallucination he wanted to ignore her charmand here she was tantalising him afresh,0
are we not all fond of money he said with a forced laugh are not you fond of money,0
am i queried she and the blue eyes glanced up with genuine astonishment,0
why of course you are were all fond of it i say we men toil for it we sell our brains for itwe sell our strength and power and the best years of our lives for it and you women,0
he paused rosalie surprised at his vehemence but still half amused inquired lightly,0
well what do we do take care of it when weve got it and do without it when we have nt,0
not always he added and this time there was no mistaking the deliberate insolence of his tone sometimes a woman sells herself when she has nt got it and sometimes mistrusting her own powers of management she invites other people to take care of it for her,0
there was a dead silence for a moment richard fixing his merciless gaze upon her face saw the colour ebb from it leaving the very lips white his shot had struck homehe was glad of it,0
what do you mean said rosalie at last lifting her eyes which she had involuntarily lowered and looking at him steadily,0
i think you must know what i mean he returned with a smile almost insulting in its contemptuousness,0
why should you attack me she inquired without flinching though her large eyes looked pathetic in their surprise and pain,0
am i attacking you i am merely stating facts when a penniless young girl marries a prosperous old man one is bound to conclude that his money is the chief attraction and when that same girl finding herself a few years later rich and free offers herself for the second time to a man forty years older than herself,0
offers herself cried rosalie turning upon him fiercely while the blood returned impetuously to her face how dare you say such an insulting thing to me,0
is it not true he inquired i have the statement on most excellent authority,0
rosalie dropped her flowerladen skirt a yellow shower falling at her feet and buried her face in her hands,0
oh she groaned isaac told you that hehe saidoh how could he,0
the beautiful shoulders heaved tears trickled through her fingers but richard steeled his heart against her let her sufferlet her cry these selfish tears could not expiate the things that she had done tears and subterfuges were womans natural weapons but they should not avail her she should be made to realise her own vileness,0
rosalie dropped her hands and raised her head her lip was still quivering but her eyes shone through the tears,0
i deny nothing she said and without another word walked away from him down the slope and across the field passing through a gate at the further end,0
richard stood looking after her until she was out of sight then his eyes reverted to the heap of primroses lying at his feeta tumbled heap sweet and dewy and freshjust as they had fallen from her gown,0
mechanically he stooped and began to gather them together but presently he threw back again the flowers he had picked up,0
what should i do with them he murmured half aloud straightening himself he passed his hand across his brow and looked round him with a blank stare what have i done he said,0
colin the grass was grey and wet the sod oer which i heard her velvet footfall come but heaven where yet no pallid crescent rode flowered in fire behind the bloomless plum there stirred no wing nor wind the wood was dumb only blown roses shook their leaves abroad on stems more tender than an infants thumb soft leaves soft hued and curled like cupids lip and each dim tree shed sweetness over me from honeydews that breathless boughs let slip in the orchard by the sea,0
ye baint sich very good company tonight richard remarked mr sharpe laying down his knife and fork and gazing critically at his nephew nay i cant say as ye be you have nt opened your mouth since we sat down except just to put a bit into it now and again and not too often neither ye baint eatin nothing to speak on an ye have nt a word to throw to a dog whats amiss,0
whynothing returned richard rousing himself with a startled look from the brown study into which he had fallen i suppose i am tired he added as an afterthought,0
ah very like ye be agreed the farmer commiseratingly it just depends on what a mans used to how soon he gets knocked up you be used to town an travellin and that and when you come back to the ploughin it tries you a bit to start wi t is just the other way wi i im used to the country d ye see and when i do have to go to townto dorchester or weymouth or any big place like thatlard i do get mortal tired walkin them streets now and lookin in at the shopwindersdear heart alive it makes me so weary as i could very nigh drop down in the middle of em as for travellingoin in trains an sichlikeit do make me so stiff i can scarce lay legs to the ground when i do light from em but i dare say you found it a hardish bit o work turnin up the big field yonder,0
his nephew made no response and isaac bawled out the question afresh,0
the young man who had been absently balancing a fork on his forefinger started and replied hastily that he had nt found it at all hardat leastyes perhaps rather hard but very pleasant and he liked the work,0
isaac took a farewell pull at his pint mug set it down and pushed his plate away,0
draw up to the fire lad he said and smoke your pipe quick and then turn inye baint fit for nothin but bed,0
no no returned richard hastily as he rose i could not go to bed yetit is not much past eight i dont think ill sit down by the fireill go out for a stroll to stretch my legs,0
stretch your legs commented his uncle indignantly hant ye stretched them enough today already youve aworked hard enough for two men,0
no remedy so good as a hair of the dog that bit you you know said richard a brisk turn will take the stiffness off and it is a lovely evening,0
lard how restless these young chaps do be ejaculated isaac as he scraped his chair across the tiled floor to the hearth a body mid think hed be glad enough to set down for a bit ill engage hell find it hard enough to turn out tomorrow morn,0
when richard had proceeded a little way he paused and drew a long breath then wheeling round swiftly began to retrace his steps brought himself to a standstill for the second time his hands clenched his eyes fixed finally crying aloud i will do iti must do it he turned once more and pursued his former course,0
the sun had set some time before but the heavens were still luminous the rosy glow which lingered at the horizon merging into soft primrose which in its turn melted into an exquisite ethereal green against this lambent background the hills and woods stood out darkly purple while the little copses scattered here and there upon the downs and the hedge at the further end appeared to be almost black little parties of his uncles sheep scurried out of richards way a bell tinkling here and there among them birds flew almost into his face as he passed the groups of trees before alluded to when he forced his way through the hedge a trailing tendril of honeysuckle wet with the heavy dew flapped against his face every now and then a rabbit crossed his path its passage scarcely noticeable in the dusk save for the flash of its little white tail there must have been thyme growing on or about those downs for its fragrance was strong in the air richard did not however pause to inhale itit is even doubtful if he noticed it yet when byandby entering rosalies fields he skirted a bank overgrown with primroses their perfume for a moment turned him almost faint,0
here was the house at lasthow quiet at this hour nothing seemed to be stirring no one was about,0
susan appeared in answer to a somewhat tremulous knock and informed him that her mistress was in the garden,0
no no he returned quickly i will go to heri only want to see her for a moment,0
who knew she might refuse to obey the summons it was best to come upon her without warning,0
round to the left explained susan the path leads you up to the gate,0
following her directions and passing through the little wicket richard presently found himself in the walled enclosure which had once been the manor house garden for littlecomb had been the dower house of a noble family along the straight prim paths stately ladies had loved to pace and the lavender hedge which was rosalies pride had been the pride of many a titled dame before her it was more of a pleasant wilderness than a garden now having been neglected by elias and his predecessors on the farm but rosalie was endeavouring to reclaim it and already had made progress with the work richard walking slowly onward glanced anxiously down the dim alleys and peered into various overgrown bowers at length amid a mass of distant greenery he descried a moving figure and quickening his pace advanced towards it the afterglow had now almost faded and the moon had not yet risen here beneath these high walls and amid this dense growth everything looked shadowy and unreal,0
he would scarcely have distinguished which was path and which was flowerborder had he not been guided towards the spot where she stood by a double line of white pinks now a blossomladen applebough barred his progress now he passed beneath an arch of monthly roses brushing off the moisture from leaf and bloom as he went,0
is that you susan come here for a moment i want you to hold this branch,0
richard made no reply but hastened on the shadowy figure turned and he saw the pale silhouette of her face she was standing beneath a great bush laden with white blossoms which from their size and perfume he judged to be lilac she had drawn down a branch and was endeavouring to detach one of the clustering blooms,0
she loosed the branch which flew rustling up to join its fellows and made a step forward he could see her face more clearly now the gleam of her white teeth between her parted lips he even fancied that he could detect an angry sparkle in her eyes,0
why do you come here she said here at least i supposed myself safe,0
i came replied richard in an unsteady voice to beg your pardon most humbly most sincerely for my conduct to you today,0
it was inexcusable she said after a pause it seemed to him that she was breathing quicklyperhaps with a just and natural anger,0
i cannot even understand it she pursued what had i done to you how do my private concerns affect you,0
there was a long silence and then richard said almost in a whisper,0
i can make no excusei think i must have been mad when i came to myself i feltas if i could kill myself for my brutality to you all day the shame of it has been eating into my souli feel branded disgraced i cannot rest until you tell me you have forgiven me,0
there was silence again broken only by the faint warbling of a thrush singing to his mate in the warm dusk,0
you ask a great deal said rosalie at last i scarcely know how i can forgive you,0
she saw the dark figure sway a little but he spoke quietly,0
i can only say that i would give my life to recall those insulting words of mine,0
words she repeated words count for little that you should think of me thusthat you should judge me so harshly,0
he said nothing the thrush sang on the liquid notes rising and falling with almost unendurable sweetness,0
then i entreat you he pleaded once more i entreat you to forgive me,0
she stretched out her hand in silence and he took it without a word it was cold very cold and it trembled,0
she drew it away almost as soon as his fingers had closed upon it and he turned and went away his footsteps falling with unaccustomed heaviness on the little path and presently the gate swung to behind him,0
isaac was sitting by the dying fire a foot resting on either hob and surrounded by a haze of tobaccosmoke when his nephew entered he looked towards richard with an aggrieved expression as he crossed the room,0
well them there legs o yourn should be pretty well stretched by now i was wonderin whether you were comin back at all tonight where have ye been all this while,0
richard hesitated and then throwing back his head answered deliberately,0
what to littlecomb at this time o night what ever took ee there so late,0
why to tell you the truth i went to make an apology to mrs fiander she came across the top field today when i was ploughing and i said something which hurt her feelingsin fact i offended her very much and i felt i could not rest tonight without begging her pardon,0
oh said the farmer and then paused eyes and mouth round with astonished concern well he continued presently im glad as ye polygised im very glad as ye polygised richard ees that was very well done of ee but what did you go for to offend her for,0
he leaned forward anxious wrinkles still furrowing his brow and puckering up his mouth as though he was going to whistle byandby indeed he did actually whistle under his breath and without any regard for tune richard meanwhile stood looking down into the fire as though he had not heard the question,0
oh i beg your pardon i cant think im sure how i came to forget myself so i was out of temper i suppose,0
ah commented the farmer well i can say truly as she and me ha never had a word not since i knowed her nay not so much as one word we did alays get on wonderful well in lias time and now i do really think as we gets on better than ever,0
so you ought to said richard a trifle irritably then he added in a softer tone i dont believe anyone could quarrel with you uncle isaac,0
well d ye see explained isaac waving his pipe impressively even if i was a quarrelsome manwhich i bainti never should ax to quarrel wi she im oncommon fond o mrs f,0
to this richard made no rejoinder stretching out his foot he pushed the logs together and then stood looking down at them again,0
im sorry richard as ye should ha hurt her feelings went on the farmer after ruminating for some time in evident distress of mind ah i be very sorry for that but ye could nt do no more nor polygise nay ye could nt do more nor that im glad ye did polygise richard,0
so am i said richard huskily adding with the same irritation which he had previously displayed not that it makes much difference one way or the other,0
t is a bad thing went on the farmer for to hurt a womans feelins in the beginning of acquaintance it makes a bad start d ye see it do rouse up notions as theyd maybe never ha thought on if they was nt crossed in the beginning now my poor motheryour grandmother richardshe did have sich tender feelins there was no livin in th house wi her and my fatherah ive heard en tell the tale many a timehe did always set it down to his not havin been careful to keep the right side o her when they was acoortin twas this way d ye see my father was a bit of a buck in his day an amost up to the time when he had his banns put up wi my mother he liked to have his fling dye see hed walk o one sunday wi one maid and the next maybe hed go along wi another and the third maybe hed go afishin and thered be my poor mother wi her best bonnet on all the time alookin out for en so anxious and she got that upset in her feelins and that nervous ye know that she was nt the better for it all her life after ah ive heard my father say often when shed scratched his face for him or thrown his hat into the washtub t is my own fault he d say i did nt use to consider her feelins as a young un and her feelins is acomin agen me now,0
isaac shook his head slowly over this affecting reminiscence and restored his pipe to its favourite corner richard said nothing for a moment but presently turned towards his uncle with a smile,0
dont you be afraid uncle isaac mrs fianders temper is perfect i am sure i was entirely in fault today and i will promise most faithfully not to do anything which might disturb your peace of mind in future,0
though he spoke with assumed lightness there was an earnest look in his eyes,0
some friendship is feigning most loving mere folly then heigh ho the holly this life is most jolly,0
when sunday came round isaac sharpe surprised his nephew by inviting him to accompany him on his usual visit to littlecomb,0
i dont think you want me said richard colouring and hesitating i should only be in the way two are company and three are none you know,0
nay now t is a silly notion that the more the merrier i say besides i have particular reasons for wanting you to come today you and mrs f have nt met since that night as ye polygised have ye,0
and i noticed you hung behind when i was talkin to her arter church this mornin was ee ashamed o meetin her,0
nay but that will never do if ye go on ahangin back and akeepin out o her way things will get awkarder and awkarder atween ye now take my advice and come along wi i quite quiet and natral itll all pass off so easy as ye could wish just drop in same as myself i want ee to be friends,0
well i cant refuse if you put it like that said marshall and the two sallied forth together,0
in spite of mr sharpes prognostication there was decidedly a little awkwardness about the young peoples meeting rosalie greeted richard somewhat stiffly and invited him with formal politeness to take a seat,0
t is a fine day began isaac as he installed himself in the highbacked elbowchair which had now become his by consecrated right rosalie responded hastily that it was a very fine day,0
ah remarked the farmer with a covert note of warning in his voice my nevvy was asayin as we come along that it was a wonderful fine day for the time o yeardid nt ee richard,0
as it happened to be the time of year when fine days were not uncommon this alleged observation would not have testified to any extraordinary perspicacity on richards part but as a matter of fact it was entirely fictitious nevertheless the young man did not repudiate it,0
yes he said with his eyes on the floor yes to be sure,0
did nt ee find it oncommon warm in church mrs f pursued mr sharpe after a short silence,0
yes i did agreed she i was longing for someone to open the door,0
mrs f d say cried isaac turning to his nephew with an explanatory bawl which was intended to stimulate him to further efforts at conversationmrs f d say richard as she found it oncommon warm in church,0
richards eyes travelled slowly from the carpet to his uncles face where they rested for the life of him he could not muster courage to move them to the blooming face on the other side,0
ees said isaac emphatically do ee ax her here he jerked his thumb significantly in rosalies direction she d say as she was awishin as somebody ud open the doordid nt ee my dear,0
ah shell tell ee about that richard went on isaac and his enormous boot came slowly sliding across the floor till it reached richards foot which it proceeded to kick in an admonitory fashion jist ax her about thatif yed ha known she was wantin the door open youd ha opened it fast enough for mrs f would nt ee richard,0
certainly responded marshall with his eyes still glued on his uncles face,0
ah you can jist talk about that hinted the latter as he proceeded to search in his pocket for his pipe,0
a dead silence ensued isaac looked from one to the other and the perspiration stood upon his brow his strenuous efforts had exhausted him but the desired consummation seemed just as far off as ever,0
have you got your tobaccobox uncle isaac inquired the dutiful nephew presently,0
there they were again what was the good of their talking to him he wanted them to talk to each other,0
richard said isaac after sucking for a moment at his pipewhen rosalie applied the match a flash of inspiration had come to himrichard my boy ye have nt been round this here farm since ye come home have ee,0
no said richard but i know it well of old,0
ah but theres been improvement since ye lefttheres been a many improvements yed better take him round mrs f and show him all whats been done the last few years he be oncommon fond o stretching his legsrichard beand itll just suit himwont it richard,0
richard stammered confusedly that he should like it of all things,0
and you be a wonderful one for fresh air yourself mrs f went on the diplomatist jist take en out and show en everything theres a good soul,0
rosalie had risen willingly enough for she had found the previous constraint exceedingly uncomfortable but she now paused hesitatingly,0
nay my dear ill stay where i be t is very comfortable here i th chimney corner and i baint so young as i was d ye see nay you two young folks can go out and freshen yourselves up a bit and make acquaintance and the wold man will bide at home and smoke his pipe and be ready for tea when you come back,0
he nodded at them both with an air of finality and twisted round his chair so as to present to their gaze a large and inflexible back,0
well then we had better start if we are to be back by teatime said rosalie a little sharply and richard took up his hat and followed her out in silence,0
the whole place was wrapped in sabbath stillness milking was over and a distant line of red and dappled cows was vanishing down the lane followed by one or two of the dairy chaps with white pinners protecting their sunday clothes save for the calves which thrust their blunt moist noses through the bars of their enclosure and the fowl cackling lazily as they lay sunning themselves in the angle of the barn the barton was absolutely deserted,0
we drained the big mead four years ago said rosalie and threw the twentyacre into it t is beautiful pasture now would you like to see it,0
richard hurriedly expressed a desire to that effect and the two betook themselves in silence along a narrow farmtrack to the rear of the house which led to the field in question they walked with the breadth of the lane between them and in unbroken silence their eyes by common accord gazing straight in front and both secretly rebelling against the expedient which isaac had deemed so happily devised at length they came to a gate set in the hedge and turned to look over it a great green expanse stretched away before their gaze meeting the skyline on one side where it sloped upwards and melting on the other into the lighter more delicate green of springing corn beyond were the woods which as well as the low line of hills behind them were covered by a gentle haze,0
richard leaned his elbows on the topmost rail of the gate and his face gradually cleared as his eyes roamed over the landscape,0
this county of dorset has given birth to more than one great writer of lowly origin whose early nurture amid field and heath and woodland has fostered an intimate and loving sympathy with nature to which each in turn has given exquisite expression richard marshall born of the same sturdy peasant stock brought up amid the same pastoral surroundings possessed a somewhat kindred spirit though he was denied this gift of expression yet the inglorious rustic milton was not always mute he had read so much and meditated so much and above all felt so deeply that at times something of what he thought and felt struggled to his lips and found vent in words inadequate indeed but suggestive,0
how beautiful it all is he said turning to rosalie with a very poets rapture in his eyes it seems to fill one like music,0
yet i suppose you have seen far finer sights during your travels returned she speaking naturally for the first time as she too leaned over the gate,0
finer things oh yes perhaps but this homely beauty touches me as no other sight could do something about a great sketch of green like this always affects me curiously i love these wide fields,0
yes i remember your saying so said rosalie the ice was broken now and she could talk to him freely even taking courage to broach a subject which had much occupied her thoughts lately you told me you know how pleased you were at the sight of the cornfield inin my picture,0
he did not turn towards her and continued to scan the mead but over his brown face she saw the colour rush quickly,0
oh yes he said of course i remember telling you about it,0
i wanted to ask you waswas the picture a very large one and was it well painted,0
yes very large indeed and beautifully painted there was an iron railing in front of it because people pressed round it so i was told it was the picture of the year,0
was it cried rosalie and at the note of delight in her voice he turned and looked at her with a smile her cheeks were pink with excitement her eyes shining oh she cried with a sigh of longing i would give anything to see it,0
i have a little print of it here returned he impulsively i cut it out of a paper it will give you some idea of it though of course a very poor one,0
in another moment he partly withdrew from its enclosure the print in question holding the envelope firmly in his own hand however so that the charred margin was hidden,0
see he said pointing with his disengaged hand there is your houseover there in the corner and here are your men and here under the piledup sheaves are you but of course the figure in the picture is far more like you,0
i see said rosalie yes it must be a nice picture and you say it is beautifully done,0
it is beautifully done it is so real so vivid that i felt as if i could walk into the picture these sheaves stand out so that one might think it easy to pass behind them,0
he glanced up as he said these words and was surprised to see rosalie colour almost to the temples his own heart gave a sudden throb was it possible that she had divined the audacious thought which had so often come to him as he recalled that picture and which since his uncles revelations he had resolutely striven to banish,0
as a matter of fact there did happen to be a certain similarity between this thought of his and that which had caused rosalie to change colour for there had flashed across her mind the remembrance of the unknown artists words perhaps if i come across a very attractive specimen of a rustic i may place him just behind the stook,0
this is the name underneath i suppose she said hastily what is the picture called i cannot see from here,0
she was dumb for a moment hot waves of colour rushing over brow and neck what was it the man had said last year you will wake up some day my beauty words of ill omen they had often tantalised and tormented her but now as they recurred to her her heart seemed to stand still ashamed of her burning face on which the young mans eyes were now fixed and of the agitation which she could not master she suddenly bent forward confusedly,0
what is the name of the painter let me look,0
before richard could divine her intention she had snatched the print from his hand its black and jagged edges immediately catching her eye,0
why she said in an altered tonewhy it is burnt,0
it was now richards turn to look confused i began to burn it but repented of my intention,0
you wanted to burn it said rosalie because you were so angry with me why were you so angry with me was it because ofof what your uncle told you,0
i know he did not mean to do me harm said rosalie tremulously but i dont think hehe can have made you understand properly everything was going wrong andand i was so much bothered i found i could not manage by myself and he had been my poor eliass friendshe was beginning to sob nowand i knew i could trust him not to do anything elias would nt have liked andoh it is so difficult to explain,0
pray do not try to explain said richard very gently,0
but you should nt misjudge me as you do cried she and then burst into tears,0
i do not misjudge you now said richard in a low voice oh dont cry i assure you i understand you have been quite rightquite right all along,0
the big tearful blue eyes looked at him over the crumpled handkerchief,0
but you saidyou said i sold myself she gasped you should nt have said that i loved my husband,0
i am sure you did said richard gravely and tenderly,0
yes indeed i did i loved him from the first he was like a father to me,0
yes yes said richard and he looked at her with an odd mixture of wonder and compassion,0
he was just as kind and dotingly fond of me as my own dear granfer,0
to be sure said richard yes no wonder you loved him,0
something in his tone caused rosalie to pull down her handkerchief and to cast a keen glance at him,0
why do you look at me like that she said passionately,0
was i looking at you in any particular way returned he averting his eyes quickly,0
yes you were you were looking at me as if you were sorry for me how dare you be sorry for me,0
were you not telling me he said quietly how much you felt the loss of your good old husband,0
you know it was not that she retorted you looked at me as if i were a child who had no senseas if i did not know what i was saying,0
is that what you really think of me pursued she her eyes full of wrathful fire though the tears were still standing on her cheeks answer mei insist on your answering me,0
richards gaze had been fixed on the little print which she was holding and rosalie marking this had felt an increase of indignation did he dare to share the opinion which the artist had so impertinently pronounced rousing himself however he turned towards her and their eyes met,0
i do think he said that you know very little of life perhaps it is all the better for you the fruit of the tree of knowledge is nearly always bitterand sometimes it is poisonous,0
rosalie was about to make a very angry rejoinder when the sound of steps close to them made them both suddenly start on looking round they beheld a loving couple such as are so frequently to be met with in rural districts on sunday afternoons sauntering down the lane,0
rosalie hastily restored her handkerchief to her pocket and again leaned over the gate endeavouring to assume a careless attitude but she was secretly much annoyed for the young man who was so gallantly escorting a much befringed and beribboned lady was no other than sam belbin at any other time she would have been somewhat amused on discovering how soon her lowly admirer had consoled himself he was working at branston now and his companion was evidently a townswoman but that he should come on her just then in the midst of her tears and wrath with richard marshall in such close proximity was most vexatious,0
sam stared hard as he approached taking in as rosalie felt though she did not again look towards him every compromising detail of the situation when they had passed on he made some facetious remark to the girl on whose arm he was hanging to which she responded by loud laughter,0
the little incident impressed rosalie disagreeably she turned to richard petulantly holding out the little print which had been the cause of so much agitation,0
isaac looked so placid and cheery when they entered and greeted them with so bright a smile that rosalie was conscious of a sudden rush of remorse,0
going up to him she placed her hand upon his shoulder a caress which astonished its recipient mightily for he was not accustomed to endearments from her rosalie kept her hand there however glancing defiantly at richard the while as though to say you are wrong in thinking me so ignorant see how i love and appreciate this good man and richard smiled back kindly as if replying i see it indeed and i am glad that you are content,0
well said isaac squinting down sideways at rosalies hand well mrs f did you take en all over the place,0
i took mr marshall to see the big mead returned she a little doubtfully,0
ah im sure he thought that improved well and then you took en up to see the root crop,0
nono we did nt go there we did nt like to go too far as you were here by yourself,0
why i were all right here isaac slowly lifted the shoulder on which rosalies hand still lingered and again glanced down at it as taking the hint she withdrew it he gently rubbed the place where it had rested,0
you took en down to the carnfield though he continued ill engage he thought them oats was acomin on wonderful,0
but they had not been to the cornfield it appeared nor yet to see the potatoes nor round by the vegetable garden nor through the orchard they had just been to the big mead and back,0
well commented mr sharpe gazing at them in amazement ye must ha walked oncommon slow,0
we stood for some time looking at the view said richard seeing rosalie somewhat confounded,0
lookin at the view eh echoed his uncle there baint any view to speak on from the mead if youd ha gone a bit further up the lane and turned the corner yed ha had a beautiful view o branston but if you enjyed yourselves its all right,0
he wheeled round in his chair as he made this last remark and looked from one to the other of the young folks both faces were alike downcast and somewhat paler than usual after a moments scrutiny isaac became as crestfallen as they,0
so long as you enjyed yourselves he repeated slowly so long as yeve amade friendsi want ee to be friends d ye see,0
rosalie and richard glanced at each other he read in her face a kind of antagonism mingled with fear and dropped his eyes quickly lest they might betray the anguish and longing with which his heart was full to bursting,0
i want ee to be friends d ye see repeated the farmer anxiously and pleadingly theres me and you mrs f as friendly as can be and theres you and me richardyoure much the sames a son to me baint yewell then theres you and mrs f why should nt ee be friendly wi her,0
richard to whom the question was directed remained dumb friends could they ever be friends,0
rosalie however made a step forward and extended her hand,0
why should we not indeed she said to tell you the truth isaac we have done nothing but quarrel since we first met each other which was very silly and unreasonable of us now for your sake i am determined not to quarrel any more and for your sake i think he too should be willing to keep the peace,0
well said cried isaac heartily well said mrs f now richard my boy wheres your hand just catch hold o mrs fs thats itthats it shake it well here he thumped the arm of his chair jubilantly youll be the best o friends from this day forard here we be we three friends all jist as me and poor lias and mrs f was friendsdear heart alive yes we was friends toothe best o friends we was three then and we be three now baint us mrs f we three i do mind a old song as your poor dear mother used to sing richard,0
when shall we three meet agen in starm in zunshine ar in rain,0
lard yes she used to sing it poor soul well now we be three agen baint us three good friends so if youll mix the usul glass mrs f well drink to the bond o good fellowship,0
yes of course said rosalie indistinctly i forgot all about your glass isaac im so sorry ill see to it at once,0
she ran out of the room glad to make her escape and richard sat down near the hearth,0
friends they were to be friends as his uncle and elias and rosalie had once been friends he had felt her hand twitch in his as isaac had spoken to her the proposition was doubtless as distasteful as to him it was impossible what was his uncle thinking of there were some things which flesh and bloodyoung flesh and bloodcould not brook and this triangular bond was one of them but he would be patient for a little while he would choke down his rebellious sense of injury his secret thank heaven was secure neither the guileless isaac nor rosalie herself had the faintest idea of the miserable passion which he was striving so hard to conquer what was it she had said they were to be friendsfriends for his uncles sake his uncle to whom he owed everythinghis kind faithful generous old benefactor well he would try,0
that night in the seclusion of his attic room he once more drew forth rosalies picture,0
sleep on beauty he said sleep on in peace i shall not try to wake you sleep soundly do not even dream,0
and after a last silent look he held it steadily in the flame of the candle watching its destruction unflinchingly until the last feathery film dropped from his fingers,0
and times he saith why must man aye forego and why is life a nobler thing through pain and times since loves sweet apple hangs so low shall i not strongly grasp and count it gain,0
for some time after isaacs apparently successful peacemaking the friendly relations between the parties concerned remained unbroken richard was frequently sent on messages to littlecomb acquitting himself on these occasions in a strictly businesslike manner and when he accompanied his uncle thither he made such strenuous efforts to appear at his ease and to entertain its hostess that isaac was delighted beyond measure,0
how th chap d talk he would say sometimes under his breath with an admiring nod and wink bless me he d talk like prent i d low there is nt very much as my nevvy dont know,0
richard indeed in his desire to avoid those terrible long silences which had so much discomposed him during his first visits to littlecomb embarked upon wild flights of fancy related at length his past experiences and delivered his opinion upon men and things with a fluency which frequently surprised himself the fact was that he was afraid to pause were he to come to a halt when those blue eyes were fixed upon him could he ever take up the thread of his discourse again even as it was the mere consciousness of that intent gaze made him sometimes falter but recovering himself he would go on with a rush knowing that he was making many wild statements but persevering nevertheless he was bound to do all the talking if talking there must be for rosalie was very silent and his uncle was at no time garrulous,0
but the harmony of these relations was rudely broken by an unexpected incident,0
one warm afternoon early in june farmer sharpe chanced to be standing by his own gate gazing abstractedly up and down the lane presently he descried an undersized narrowchested figure making its way towards him and as it drew near recognised mr samuel cross,0
fine evenin remarked isaac nodding sideways in his direction and expecting him to pass on,0
a very fine evening mr sharpe returned samuel pausing and leaning against the gatepost with the evident intention of entering into conversation the very evenin for a quiet walk,0
walkin baint much in my line returned isaac nay not without im obliged toseein after the men and goin round the fields and across the downs to look after the sheep but walkinmeanin goin for a walk jist for pleasureit baint in my line at all,0
its in other peoples line though said samuel and he shot a cunning glance at the older man out of his little redrimmed eyes i met your nephew strolling up towards littlecomb just now,0
very like ye did agreed sharpe he do often go up there on business,0
lucky chap exclaimed cross the rest of us dont often contrive to make business agree so well with pleasure,0
he paused to snigger and isaac turned his mild grey eyes inquiringly upon him,0
nay samuel cross he remarked i dont suppose as you do,0
the slight stress laid upon the personal pronoun appeared to irritate the young gentleman and he replied with a certain acerbity,0
there is nt as a rule much pleasure to be found in doing honest business mr sharpe,0
not among lawyers said isaac nodding placidly so ive been told,0
theres others besides lawyers though cried samuel as are nt so very honest he he youre a very confiding man mr sharpea very confiding uncle t is nt everyone in your situation that would care to make such a handsome young man his businessmanager where a handsome young woman was concerned he he your nephew no doubt will do the business thoroughlyperhaps a little too thoroughly,0
my nevvy returned isaac loftily may be trusted to do his dooty samel t is more nor can be said for many folks as be all for pokin their noses where they baint wanted,0
mr crosss always sallow complexion assumed an even more jaundiced hue as he retorted,0
most people do no business on sundayin england they dont at least but i suppose mr richard marshall has brought foreign notions back with him he was seen two or three weeks ago doing business with mrs fiander quite as per usual they were standin close together lookin over a gate just as if he and she were keepin company and he was tellin her such touchin business details that she was actually crying mr sharpe,0
cryin ejaculated isaac in a kind of roar stuff and nonsense what had she to cry for,0
how should i know because prices had gone down i suppose since according to you they talk nothing but business when they are together,0
oh drop that cried the farmer losing patience at last what be you adrivin at samel cross wi your hints,0
why rejoined samuel thrusting his thumbs into his waistcoat pocketswhy the remark as was passed by the young man that saw them in the lane will perhaps throw some light on the subject says he i believe he says as the widow fiander be atakin on wi the new love before she is off wi the old so if i do drop a hint mr sharpeand samuel assumed a virtuous air and struck an appropriate attitudei do it in the way of kindness take my advice and look sharplook like your name sir we lawyers see a deal of the world a deal of the wickedness of the world and we know that worthy folks are often caught napping but dont you be caught farmerkeep a good lookout or your bride will be snapped up from under your very nose,0
now ill tell you what it is samel cross cried isaac who had been shifting from one foot to the other during the latter part of the clerks speech and was purple in the face with suppressed ire since youre so fond of advice maybe youll take a bit from me jist you keep that long tongue o yourn quiet what do ye mean ye little treecherous spy by poking your nose into other peoples business and tryin to make mischief between them thats as good as father and son i know my nevvy a deal better than you know him my nevvy baint a snapper an so i tell ee now you jist take yourself off out of this and dont ee come here wi no more lyin tales else maybe yell find this here stick o mine laid about your shoulders i baint so strong as i were but i could make a shift to hit ee a crack or twoso now ye know,0
samuel had started back as words and gestures grew threatening and now deemed it better to beat a retreat turning however at a safe distance to bestow a withering valedictory smile upon his adversary and to remark that he was sorry for him,0
ever since his rejection by rosalie he had been burning with resentment against her and desirous of an opportunity of venting it a chance meeting with sam belbin had resulted in the latters imparting to him a highlycoloured version of the scene which he had witnessed between rosalie and richard in the lane the desired opportunity seemed to have arrived and samuel had hastened to take advantage of it with as has been seen indifferent success as he now hastened away as rapidly as his short legs would carry him he encountered the very person he had been so anxious to traduce richard nodded and would have passed on but that cross who was still suffering from a redundancy of spite thought the opportunity favourable for venting it,0
you are back already he remarked i wonder you did nt contrive to be a bit longer over your business you would nt ha been missed yonder your uncle seems quite content with your doings as i told him just nowhe has a confiding nature,0
what do you mean said richard speaking in a low even voice but with an ominous flash of the eyes,0
ha you know what i mean well enough you sly young dog if you dont ask the fascinating young widowask lovely dainty mrs f she knows what shes about though she contrives to look so demure come marking the expression of richards face you need nt turn rusty over itill tell no tales bless you but theres others besides me that has been passing remarks about the widow fianders new businessmanager ha hayou may carry on though as far as i am concernedperhaps i know a little too much about the lady to envy you she has played a double game before now as for the old man hell find out nothing hes as blind as a batas blind as a bat,0
here mr cross thrust his tongue into his cheek and made a hideous contortion of countenance calculated to convey an impression of his own extreme artfulness and of his contempt for the old farmers shortsightedness,0
his own vision perhaps might with advantage have been a little clearer a man of quicker perceptions would have realised that richards persistent silence was more fraught with danger to him than a torrent of wrathful words he was therefore considerably surprised when marshall suddenly brought down his vigorous right hand upon the cheek at that moment distended by samuels malevolent tongue and before he had time to spring backwards the other palm inflicted similar chastisement on its fellow,0
the lawyers clerk gasped spluttered and finally uttered a choking howl,0
hang you youve made me nearly bite my tongue off,0
serve you right if i had cried richard you little reptile if you so much as say another word of this kind ill half kill you,0
he had seized samuel by the shoulders and was now shaking him slowly backwards and forwards,0
do you take back every word of your vile slanders,0
will you give me your word to keep that foul tongue of yours quiet in future,0
oh lord yes richard marshall for heavens sake let me go youve about half killed me as it is,0
richard released him with a parting admonition to look out and cross went on his way with a staggering gait and stuffing his pockethandkerchief into his mouth,0
richard still in a white heat of passion was striding along at a tremendous rate when he suddenly observed the large whiteclad person of his uncle standing contemplatively some twenty yards away from the scene of the encounter his good humoured face wore a pleasant and satisfied smile,0
well done lad he remarked as soon as richard came within hearing ye did give it en in style i never did see nothing more neat i do rather think richard as mr samel cross ull have the toothache i d low he will,0
i only wish i had made every bone in his body ache cried richard still fuming,0
i d low as he said something as annyed ee richard said the farmer ceasing his placid chuckles and looking intently at his nephew,0
yes returned richard he annoyed me very much hein point of fact he insulted me,0
well now commented isaac that was strange i did nt think hed insult ee to your face richard he was atalkin to me jist now and he did say some very insultin things agen youbut that was behind your back d ye see i did nt think the chap would acshally go for to say em to your face,0
why he did say rediclous things about you and mrs f ah the little raskil could nt so much as leave mrs fs name out and he were very oncivil to meye d scarce believe how oncivil he were up and told me straight out as if i did nt look out youd be snappin up mrs f without by your leave or with your leave but i give it en back well i can tell ee says i my nevvy baint a snapper says i them was my very words ye little treecherous spy i says dont ee be apokin your nose into other folks business i know my nevvy i says and my nevvy baint a snapper,0
here isaac paused to chuckle jubilantly and turning slapped his nephew jovially on the back,0
what do you think of that for an answer eh,0
why that it was an excellent one said richard beginning to stride on again so rapidly that his uncle could scarcely keep pace with him,0
and i told him too pursued the latter that if he came agen with sich lyin tales id lay my stick about his shoulders,0
im glad you said that exclaimed the young man without turning his head im glad you told him they were lying tales they are lying tales,0
and the stick isaac reminded him with modest triumph i reckon i brought it in rather neat about the stick says i i baint quite so young as i were but i could make shift to hit ee a crack or two yet,0
i wish i had thrashed him within an inch of his life came the savage comment thrown over richards shoulder,0
lard richard how you do lay them long legs o yourn to the ground panted isaac pausing to wipe his brow im fair out o breath bide a bitbide a bit let me blow there dont ee be in sich a takin lad i reckon them there little taps as ye gave samel cross ull keep en quiet for some time he be gone tother way anyhow and it wont do ee no good to run me off my legs,0
richard came slowly back his face was fixed and stern but he spoke more quietly,0
uncle i blame myself to a certain extent for what has happened i might have guessed that in a gossiping little place like this people would talk if i went so often to littlecomb i must keep away altogether for the present,0
nay now dont ee let yourself get so upset what signifies a bit of idle chatter you dont need to take no notice of it at all,0
but i will take notice of it cried richard i dont choose that people should take liberties with my name and what is worsewith hers i need not assure you uncle isaac that i have never said one word to mrs fiander that anyone need find fault with,0
to be sure agreed isaac of course not he came to a sudden pause however and cast a sidelong look at his nephew scratching his jaw meditatively there was one dayone sundaysamel cross was asayin somebody seed you both standin alookin over a gate and mrs f was acryin that was nt very likely i dont think t was nt very likely as youd say aught as ud make mrs f cry,0
richard drew a quick breath and his hands involuntarily clenched themselves,0
she did cry one day he said it was the first sunday you took me to littlecomb she imaginedhesitatinglythat i had a bad opinion of her and she cried and said i was unjust,0
thatll be the day you went to see the big mead said farmer sharpe reflectively ye had nt made friends then ye have nt made her cry since richard have ee,0
women be so fanciful ye did nt really have a bad opinion of her richard,0
she be a very dear womana very dear woman t is nt very likely as anybody ud have a bad opinion of mrs f well ye be real trew friends now and ye dont need to take no notice of idle talk let there be no coolness between ye on that account,0
richard however remained fixed in his determination to avoid littlecomb for the future and in spite of his uncles protests adhered to his resolution on the following sunday he was somewhat discomposed to find rosalies eyes straying towards him once or twice as he knelt on the opposite side of the church and it seemed to him that they wore a questioning pleading expression,0
his purpose however remained unshaken and immediately after the early dinner he went out without saying anything to his uncle and could not be found when the hour came for their weekly pilgrimage to littlecomb after waiting some time and vainly bellowing his name the farmer was obliged to go without him,0
richard was in a very taciturn mode at the evening meal and his uncles announcement that mrs f had inquired why he had not come and remarked that she saw nothing of him nowadays did not render him more inclined for conversation after supper too instead of smoking quietly he sat fidgeting in his chair for a few minutes and then rising hastily fell to pacing about the room,0
you seem mortal onaisy this evening remarked the farmer after these perambulations had continued some time sit down and light up like a decent christian,0
he pushed forward a chair invitingly with his foot and richard took it and drew his pipe from his pocket,0
ugh how hot and stuffy it was in this kitchen where in spite of the warm weather a fire was blazing the windows had not been opened all day he felt sure the odour of their recent repast still lingered in the air mingled with the fumes of the particularly rank pipe which his uncle was then enjoying he thought of the cool twilight without of the downs with the fresh breeze blowing across them of the path beside the hedge that led to littlecomb of the garden therethe garden where the thrush was singing and where the roses and syringa were in full bloom ah he could picture to himself the syringa with its white blossoms shining like pale lamps amid the dusky boughs the garden still and sweet and dewywhere she was wandering at this hour,0
his nephew obeyed but held it absently between his fingers,0
isaac poked the blazing logs with his foot and bent forward extending his hands to the glow his big red face looked unnaturally large through the surrounding haze of smoke richard half rose from his chair and then sank back again outside came the tantalising thought again outsidea few paces away were the downs and the lonely path through the fields and then the garden,0
the farmer was slowly nodding in the comfortable radiance richards unused pipe had gone out the garden the garden,0
suddenly he rose from his chair strode across the room flung open the door and was gone before his uncle had time to do more than turn his head,0
away the moor is dark beneath the moon rapid clouds have drunk the last pale beam of even away the gathering winds will call the darkness soon and profoundest midnight shroud the serene lights of heaven pause not the time is past every voice cries away,0
once outside richard flew along as though pursued by a thousand demons here were the downs with their delicious tart airbut he raced across them without pausing to inhale it now to swing over the hedge and to cover the ground that still lay between him and the garden the garden and her his heart was thumping loudly against his ribs a sound as of a rushing sea was in his ears on on there were the lights twinkling from under the dark eavesthere was the gate set in the high wall how it shook beneath his violent hand as he flung it open he stood still at last hardly breathing in his suspense was she there all was still save for the rustling of the boughs and the faint warbling of the birdsmore than one was celebrating evensong tonight what if she should not be there he walked on slowly and unsteadily now and presently there was a movement amid the greenery close at hand out of a little arbour set amid the shrubs a figure came gliding forth to meet him she paused two paces away from him and her hands fell by her sides,0
they stood facing each other in unbroken silence for a full minute and then she asked still in that breathless whisper,0
she turned and began slowly to pace down the path between the roses waves of perfume were wafted to their nostrils from the syringa blossom yes yonder stood the bush just as he had pictured to himself the remembrance suddenly flashed across richard as he walked beside her that these shrubs were sometimes called mock orange trees mock orange trees mock orange blossomhe must not pursue that thought further,0
i kept away for four days he said suddenly i tried to keep away today,0
he made no answer and they walked in silence till the end of the path was reached and then she said still falteringly,0
they turned and began to retrace their steps but when about midway up the garden she came to a standstill and looked him full in the face,0
go now she said go you must not stay here any longer,0
even in the dim light he could see that she was pale and that her figure wavered but he gazed at her as though without realising the sense of her words,0
will you not leave me she entreated when i ask you,0
he stood looking at her stupidly for a moment or two longer then the meaning of her request seemed to reach his understanding,0
i will go he said hoarsely if you will give me those flowers in your hand,0
how foolish you are she cried there yes take them and for heavens sake go,0
she thrust them towards him and he took them from her handa cluster of roses moist and sweet instead of fulfilling his promise however he made a step closer to her,0
will you put them in my coat he asked his eyes in his haggard face seemed to burn,0
the movement and the icy tone that accompanied it recalled him to himself he too drew back hesitated and then throwing the flowers on the ground with a passionate gesture departed back again through the gate across the yard under the lea of the hedge over the downs,0
here was home there was the warm light of the fire by which his uncle sat now the door was open and he stood once more in his presence now he richard would be forced to look him in the face,0
for a moment he stood with the doorhandle in his hand and then as the old man turned to smile inquiringly upon him he suddenly wheeled and fled,0
i cant he cried as he mounted the stairs i cant,0
isaac stared at the closed door for some moments as though expecting it to open again then slowly turning back to the fire listened,0
in the room overhead hasty steps were walking up and down,0
he be gone to fetch summat very like remarked the farmer as he restored his pipe to his mouth but after smoking and listening a little longer and marking that the pacing to and fro continued without intermission he jerked his thumb upwards nodded and said he baint acomin back then after pausing a moment to ruminate over this circumstance he made up his mind to the inevitable tapped his pipe upon the hob extinguished the lamp and went upstairs to bed,0
and long after he was sunk in dreamless slumbers those hasty footsteps might have been heard in the adjoining room pacing up and down up and down like the restless tread of a caged beast,0
richard was not the only one who spent an unquiet night rosalie too could find no rest for her aching heart after some hours of feverish tossing she rose dressed in the dim grey light that was just stealing over the world and seated herself by the open window she could meditate here without risk of being disturbed for the sun would not rise for an hour and more and even the earliest of her men would not appear until some time after dawn,0
with her chin resting on her hand she hearkened vaguely to the succession of sounds which betokened the awakening of nature the cock had crowed long before she had left her uneasy pillow the young sparrows had been chirping while she had clothed her weary frame but now the cuckoos note was sounding faintly from a neighbouring copse and the starlings were chattering in their nests on the ivied wall the grey veil was being gradually withdrawn from the face of the earth but even yet familiar objects were only half revealed and the most wellknown had a strange and unreal look,0
the first sunbeam had not yet struck across the sky when rosalie whose eyes had been absently fixed upon the irregular line of hedge which marked the approach to the barton saw a dark object moving slowly along it and presently into the open space before her gate there stepped the figure of a man she knew what man it was even before he had vaulted the locked gate and taken up his stand beneath her window she would have given worlds to close this window and hasten out of sight but a spell seemed to be laid upon her and she could neither move nor speak only gaze downward with dilated frightened eyes,0
you are there said richard looking up with a face as drawn and white as her own thank god i wanted to see you before i go i wanted to say goodbye,0
the power of speech returned to her and she leaned forth impulsively with a faint cry going you are going,0
yes i am going is it not the only thing i can do do you think i can bear to sit at his table and take his pay and know that i am a traitor to him in my heart,0
rosalie did not speak but richard gazing upwards saw the clasp of her hands tighten as they rested on the sill till the nails and knuckles showed white,0
he went on passionately every word he says to me stabs me every time i look at his honest unsuspicious face i feelsurely you must know what i feel im not quite a brute yet and later when you are his wifedo you think it would be possible for me to go on living within a stones throwto see you every dayto keep up the farce of friendship what do you think i am made of,0
her face was set like marble only the eyes moved after a long pause she whispered will youever come back,0
who knows he answered with a harsh laugh some time perhapswhen i am quite oldwhen i can no longer feel,0
she put her hand before her eyes and then let it drop richard saw the irrepressible anguish in them and his face changed he threw up his arms suddenly with a kind of a sob,0
for a moment longer the agonised eyes looked down into his and he thought he saw her waver but it was only for a moment her lips moved at first without emitting any sound but presently mastering herself she said firmly,0
no i tell you to goit is right for you to go,0
goodbye faltered rosalie and then there came a great sob god bless you,0
he turned as if to leave her but wheeling round looked back,0
am i to have nothing am i to be sent away without so much as a clasp of the hand,0
she had vanished from the window and for a moment he stood holding his breath would she come down to himwould she meet him at the door,0
she will not come he said to himself and once more went on his way staggering blindly forward with his head sunk upon his breast,0
had he looked back again he might have seen her creep to the window and kneel by it straining her eyes through streaming tears,0
poor rosalie poor beauty did she wake at last only to look upon the vanishing form of her prince,0
later in the day isaac sharpe came to littlecomb in great perturbation of mind he found rosalie lying on the couch in the parlour the blind being drawn downshe had a headache she said,0
dear heart alive said isaac sitting down a hand on either knee everything d seem to be goin wrong this day heres my nevvy gone off wi himself,0
gone echoed rosalie faintly turning her face to the wall,0
ees took himself off this morning wiout a word to anyone and left this here bit of a note for to explain i baint much of a hand at letter readin but bithey did read it for me and he does nt seem to give no excuse at all except that he were feelin restless he says he alays told me he were a rover and could nt settle down and now the travellin fit have come on him and he felt he must be off and he thanks me very handsome and he tells me he dont know where he be agoin to yet but when he does hell write and let me know where to send his luggage and thats all,0
thats all repeated rosalie looking at the kind troubled old face with a bewildered stare that was all of course and she had known it before she had with her own eyes watched richards departing figure until it had disappeared from sight she had known quite well that he would never return she had even told him to go agreed with him that it was the right and honourable thing to dothe only thing to do ever since the morning she had been telling herself so over and over again yet none the less the farmers words fell like a knell upon her heart,0
you do look bad to be surei am sorry your head be so bad lard lard what a world this be im that upset i dont know whether im on my head or my heels,0
the quaver in his voice smote rosalie she must make an effort to overcome her selfish grief above all to conquer that mad spirit of rebellion which every now and then rose rampant within her this good man had need of her sympathy should she not give it all the more willingly that there was so large an element of remorse mingled with her misery she sat up and looked affectionately towards him,0
t was so sudden ye see pursued isaac dolefully he never so much as said a word to inever so much as hinted as he war nt satisfied i mid ha seen that the restless fit were acomin on if i had nt ha been sich a sammy restless he were that restless last night he were more like a dog at a fair as had lost his master nor a reasonable human being it was up and down and in and out the whole blessed evening ah i be terrible upset i be oncommon fond o richard d ye see always was from the time he were a little un i was oncommon fond o his mother afore him she were the only woman i ever could put up wipresent company excepted,0
as isaac ducked his head towards her with a melancholy attempt at jocularity rosalies heart sank lower still she turned away hastily that he might not see her face at an earlier period she might have been gratified by the knowledge that she was one of the few women in the world whom isaac sharpe could put up withphrases of the kind were his nearest approach to ardour and indicated as she knew a considerable amount of solid attachment but the passionate tones of richards voice had rung too recently in her earthe look in his eyes was too fresh in her memory ah what had she not seen in those eyes,0
ees went on her unconscious future husband ees ill be like to miss en him and me was the best of friendsand thats not all his leaving me like this be terrible illconvenient just nowt is the busy time of year dye seehaymaking timeevery pair o hands is wanted richard did very near the work o two men and he must go trapesing off wi hisself giving me no time at all to find somebody to take his place,0
there was a distinct sense of injury in his tone now,0
i am sure he never thought of that cried rosalie quickly and resentfully how could isaac find it in his heart to think of such things in the face of the overwhelming fact that richard was gone,0
ah sure he did nt agreed isaac t is a very bad job a very bad job indeed but i suppose there baint nothing to be done,0
rosalie agreed with a sigh it was too true there was nothing to be done,0
labsence est lamour ce quest au feu le vent il teint le petit mais it allume le grand,0
several days passed and richard made no sign rosalie went about looking like the ghost of herself it was known that she was suffering from a very severe attack of neuralgia which oddly enough had first seized her on the very day of richard marshalls sudden departure,0
some guileless people believed in the neuralgiapoor mrs fiander did look so very bad and a body could nt make believe to be so pale others among whom was mrs belbin folded their arms and assumed a knowing air t was likely enough averred this matron for folks to look pale as had reason to mrs fianders conscience was very likely atroublin o she she was a terrible one for carryin on wi young menaleadin of them on and then asendin them off wiout no reason her sam could say somethin if he d a mindher sam did know more than he did like to talk about others again were of opinion that mrs fiander was just wasting away for love of mr sharpes nephew and that that young man had gone of his own accord and had not been dismissed by the widow t was nt very likely said these sages that richard marshall who had his own way to make in the world and who was known to have great expectations from his uncle would wish to have any unpleasantness with him in response to the suggestion that the young man would nt be adoin so very bad for hisself if he and widow fiander made a match of it they returned conclusively that it was quite unpossible for him and widow fiander to make a match of it since her banns were to be given out almost immediately with farmer sharpe somebody had up and axed mrs fiander when the wedding was to be and she had answered that the day was not yet fixed but that the wedding was to take place as agreed at the end of july,0
isaac heard none of these rumours but he too wandered about with an unusually lengthy and gloomy face,0
one day however rosalie looking out from the darkened room where she was sitting saw him hastening towards her house with every appearance of excitement waving a piece of paper in his hand,0
in a moment she stood on the threshold you have heard from richard she cried eagerly you have had a letter,0
nay my dear i have nt had no letter panted isaac as soon as he was near enough i ve had a graft,0
i have had a graft my dear a telegraftin one of them nastylookin yeller wrappers as alays seems to bring bad news,0
i hope it has nt brought bad news this time said she tremulously as they went into the house together,0
nay i hope not said the farmer doubtfully it does nt say much d ye seenot much one way or t other,0
smoothing out the paper he handed it to her upside down,0
send luggage as soon as possible lime street station liverpool to be called forrichard,0
liverpool then he must intend to go to america again,0
now mrs f i do call that ajumpin to conclusions he said presently quite testily for him you have nt no earthly reason for sayin sich a thing is it likely my nevvy ud go off to merica again when hes only just acomed back did nt he say he was alongin and alongin to be back to the old country,0
i know interrupted rosalie quickly but for all that im sure he means to return to america now he told me he landed at liverpool and depend upon it he intends to start from there again yes yes im quite sure of it he did not rest you see until he had put the length of the country between us and now he means to go further stillperhaps when he is at the other side of the world he will be contented,0
she spoke with irrepressible bitterness but isaac did not notice it,0
if thats your opinion mrs f he said we d best lose no time in carryin out my little plan i ve got a plan d ye see he added with modest triumph ah it comed to me all of a sudden well write to him mrs f,0
but what would be the use of writing said rosalie we cannot force him to come back against his will,0
nay we cant force him but i think t is only some notion the chaps got in his head he seemed quite settled till last week and maybe the rovin fit will ha wore off a bit by now hes gone all the way to liverpool d ye seethat ought to ha let off a bit o steam maybe if we wrote him a letter and just axed him straight out he might change his mind we can send a letter with his luggaget wont be too late so long as he has nt left the country and he cant leave the country wiout his luggage d ye see we can but try,0
of courseyou can try said rosalie pressing her hand to her head with a bewildered air,0
so i were thinkin mrs f if ye d jist set down and drop a line to en for methats to say if your head baint atroublin you too much,0
he was looking at her pleadingly misunderstanding the expression of her face,0
oh never mind about my head im only wonderingim only thinking must the letter go today,0
well ye see richard did ax most perticlar for his traps to be sent off at once replied the farmer his eyes round with anxiety and if we dont send the letter at the same time we mid miss him,0
bithey used always to write to him for you didnt she said rosalie catching at the last straw perhaps it would have more effect if she wrote,0
nay now my dear if ye d be so obligin i d take it very kind o you to do it it d take bithey very near three days to write a letteri d be very much obliged to ee my dear he repeated persuasively,0
thus adjured she had no resource but to comply and with a beating heart and throbbing brain she set about her preparations going to the window she drew up the blind a little way and then collecting pen ink and paper sat down opposite isaac at the table when she had thus inaugurated proceedings isaac might have been observed to gather himself up concentrating as it were all his forces in preparation to the effort of composition,0
having dipped her pen in the ink rosalie looked inquiringly at him,0
bithey do alays start off wi my dear nevvy responded isaac in a husky tone as though he were speaking from beneath a blanket which evidently resulted from the mighty constraint he was putting upon himself,0
my dear nephew wrote rosalie and then she raised her eyes again,0
the farmer cleared his throat drew a long breath and continued slowly and with apparently immense difficulty,0
say repeated rosalie when she had written the last word,0
isaac crimson in the face was absorbed in the mental struggle but presently perceived with a start that her pen had stopped moving,0
have ee got say well your uncle isaac do sayas i hope youll change your mind,0
had nt i better put he hopes said the secretary,0
the farmer came out of his brown study and looked up at her inquiringly,0
why you of course if i say your uncle isaac i ought to go on in the same way he says if i say i it will look as if i were speaking of myselfas if it were i who wished he would change his mind,0
well and dont ee wish it asked isaac sharply but reproachfully too,0
rosalie bent her head over the paper and answered hurriedly,0
i oh of course of course but it would not do for me to tell him soit would be too much of a liberty,0
lard no my dear richard would nt think it such but there i be dathered with so much talkyou must nt cut in again mrs ft is terrible hard work writin letters and if ye go for to speak to i in the middle ill be all mixed up let me tell ee my own way d ye seerichard knows my ways and hell understand fast enough now let me seeyour uncle isaac wishes for to say as i hope yell change your mind and come back mrs f is awritin this for i and she wishes for to say t is uncle isaac as wants ee backthatll make it all right d ye see he continued dropping the high unnatural tone which seemed essential to dictation and adopting a confidential onenow he cant go for to make no mistakes have ee wrote that,0
nooh dont make me write that mr sharpei dont want him to think me unkind,0
lard ha mercy he ejaculated this here letter ull never get wrote now my dear jist put down what i d tell eeand dont flurry me when i do get flurried i cant for the life o me think o nothin jist be aputtin o that down and ill go on thinkin d ye see itll come rightyell find itll come right,0
rosalie reluctantly set down the required sentence and found at its conclusion that isaac had already inflated himself in preparation for a further effort,0
mrs f d wish ee to come back too as is natral but she thinks it more becomin not to say so,0
he fixed his eyes sternly upon her as he enunciated this statement and in sheer desperation rosalie set it down,0
now ye have nt nothing to complain of i dont think he remarked triumphantly now we can get on wellwhat next,0
t is most onconvenient for ee to be aleavin me at such short notice iwisheemostperticlartocomebacktoweek we be a goin to cut the church meadow and every hand be wanted i do feel a bit hurt in my feelinshere isaac paused to brush his coat sleeve across his eyes and continued brokenlyhurt in my feelins to think as you have aleft your old uncle like that t war nt well done o him he muttered parenthetically nay i cant say as it were well done o richard,0
he wiped his eyes again sniffed drew an immense breath and started off afresh,0
like that i do think ye mid ha said a word but i will not find fault no more but jist ax ye to come straight backan all will be forgive and forgot now i think mrs f we mid finish ye mid jist write my name and ill put my mark to it,0
he heaved a deep sigh of relief wiped his brow and sat gazing at her as she appended his signature to the page,0
that be my name be it he inquired it do look very pretty wrote out so nice and small ees i can see as this heres my name isa you put a twice mrs f,0
ah said the farmer gazing at the page doubtfully bithey now do only put it onceit be a matter o taste i suppose well now ill put my mark,0
he ground his pen slowly into the paper horizontally and perpendicularly and remained gazing at it with a certain modest pride,0
there shut en up now and write his name outside,0
rosalie obeyed and held out the document towards isaac but as he was about to take it she drew it back a deep flush overspreading her face after a moments hesitation however she again tendered it to him,0
theretake it she said with a note of sharpness in her voice which would have struck a more acute observer than isaac but he duly pocketed it without noticing that anything was amiss,0
left to herself she sat for a moment or two in deep thought her chin propped upon her hands then suddenly rising rushed out into the yard,0
but the farmers broad back was already vanishing down the lane evidently her voice failed to reach him as he did not turn his head rosalie stood looking after him without making further attempts to attract his attention and then slowly returned to the house why should she call him back after allwhat need was there for her thus to disturb herself could she help writing the letter exactly as he wished and how foolish were the qualms of conscience which the remembrance of certain phrases in it evoked it was his letter not hers it was he who had insisted on stating that she wished richard to returnshe had never authorised him to do so if richard did come back she could not be blamed for it if he did come back,0
again supporting her throbbing head with her hands she tried to reason with herself but the turmoil in heart and brain for a time forbade any consecutive train of ideas during the long blank days which had passed since richards departure and often in the course of the weary restless nights this thought had constantly recurred to her with a neverfailing stabhe has gonehe will never come back,0
and now if he did come backif he came back even for a little while if she might just see him again if it were only to be once or twice at the mere suggestion she was conscious of a lifting of the load which had been crushing her if he were made to know through no fault of hers but rather against her will that she did wish him to returnshe who had let him go forth without a word to stay himif he even guessed that she longed to see himoh it would be sweet to think he knew that he would henceforth judge her less harshly that he would realise how hard had been her struggle,0
she raised her head her lips parted in a smile her eyes dreamily gazing at the strip of sunlit green outside her window there he had stood thence he had turned away so mournfully and now he was to come back to come back would he not read between the lines of the oddly composed missivewould not the very words have for him a deeper meaning than their guileless originator guessed atwould he not come flying to her side in a few daysin little more than a few hours perhaps he would be with her and then,0
she gave a sudden gasp and flung herself forward across the table and then in a moment the web of selfdeception with which she had been endeavouring to cloak the situation was torn to shreds and she saw the truth a crisis was impending it was folly to pretend that it would take her unawares it was worse than folly to endeavour to shift the responsibility to poor unsuspicious isaac if richard returned the struggle would have to be gone through again it would be even harder than before for she would have lured him back after he had broken from her if thus sorely tempted and wrongfully encouraged he were to speak those words which she had seen so often trembling on his lips what answer could she make could she look him in the face and affect unconsciousness orwhat did she mean to do did she mean to keep her plighted troth as an honest woman should or did she mean to cast aside for good and all truth and honour and selfrespect and jilt the man who had been her faithful friend,0
i want to do right said rosalie with another gasping sigh i have never told a lie in my life i wont tell one now i wont act one either if he comes back it will only be on false pretences he must nt be allowed to come back,0
she lay still for a moment her arms extended a kind of tremor passing every now and then over her frame presently she said again half aloud,0
i wont be deceitful i wont break my word but oh how hard it is to do right god help me,0
she straightened herself all at once and pushed back the hair from her forehead then drawing the blotter towards her wrote a hasty line on a sheet of paperdo not come back i implore you r fthrust it into an envelope and directed it to richard with little convulsive sobs at intervals she went upstairs bathed her swollen eyes and put on her hat,0
there was no one about the down farm when she approached it but on entering she almost fell over a strapped portmanteau that had been placed just inside the doorway as she recovered herself bithey appeared at the kitchen door,0
i thought you was the carrier she remarked master did say as he d sent for him to fetch that there box o richard marshalls t is to go to liverpool today,0
is mr sharpe in asked rosalie falteringly somehow the sight of that portmanteau made her turn suddenly faint,0
nay he baint but im expectin him back every minute he be gone some time now and he said he d just catch the carrier i had a hard job to get all packed and ready but t is done now,0
it was all packed the straps fastened the lock made secure rosalie was too late after all the important postscript which was to supplement the letter could not as she intended be slipped among richards effects her heart gave a sudden throb that was not altogether of pain she had honestly tried but fate willed otherwise,0
i dont think ill wait she stammered scarcely knowing what she said i shall see mr sharpe tomorrow and i should only be in your way i dare say you are busy,0
nay not that busy now maam im just amakin a parcel of a big thick coat o richards t would nt go in the box nohow and im tryin to pack it in paper but t is that heavy it do slip out at one side so soon as i get t other wrapped up,0
let me help you said rosalie four hands are better than two,0
she had never seen richard wear this coat yet the mere sight of itthe mere consciousness that it was his caused a recurrence of that strange wave of faintness,0
we want a little bit more string bithey she said with the quaver in her voice which had been noticeable before,0
i think theres a little bit on the dresser shelf returned the old woman and dropping her end of the parcel she went across the kitchen,0
this was rosalies chance she was white to the very lips but she did not flinch with cold trembling fingers she hid away the note in the breastpocket of the coat he would be sure to find it there,0
bithey discovered nothing and presently the packet being secured rosalie betook herself homewards,0
i ve done it she said pausing when she reached the solitude of the downs thank god i ve done it it will be all right now,0
but it was not surprising that in the midst of her selfcongratulations on having so successfully barred herself out of eden she should once more melt into tears,0
had we never loved sae kindly had we never loved sae blindly never met or never parted we had neer been brokenhearted,0
the cutting and making of rosalies hay had been proceeding briskly in the church meadow the last swathes had fallen and every available pair of hands had been called upon to assist in the work for experienced weatherprophets had foretold gloomily that the actual fine spell could not be expected to last,0
towards evening on the second day farmer sharpe stood alone in the centre of the field mopped for the hundredth time his perspiring brow and cast a contemplative look round,0
t was past seven oclock the men had gone home some time before but he had remained to take a final survey of the scene of their labours,0
i dont think its so very like to rain remarked isaac looking up at the sky where indeed no trace of a cloud was to be seen nay i dont hold wi jobt will keep up for a bit yet mrs f ull ha gone home by now i should thinkshed begin to find it a bit damp in the dell the dew be falling very fast well ill go home to my supper,0
he passed through the gate at the further end of the field and had traversed more than half the distance which separated him from his home when the sound of heavy but rapid steps behind him made him halt and turn round,0
job hunt who had evidently been hastening in pursuit of him paused too his great red face wearing an appearance of unusual excitement and his sly blue eyes positively goggling in his head owing to the unusual press of work and the need for accomplishing it in a given time isaac had persuaded rosalie to consent to his engaging this unwelcome addition to her forces and she had agreed with a meekness that sufficiently indicated her spiritless condition job it was who had been most energetic in foretelling a coming storm partly in order to render his services the more valuable and partly because of a natural pleasure in predicting disaster to mrs fianders crops,0
have ee seen what be goin on yonder sir was jobs counterquery,0
why there returned hunt with a significant jerk of the thumb in the direction of the church meadow,0
there baint nothin at all agoin on there returned his employer sternly i be just come from therethe fields empty,0
nay mr sharpe returned job half closing one eye and assuming a very knowing look nay it baint empty jist you step back and see if you was to step up to the dell very cautiousid advise ee to go very cautious siryou d maybe see summat as ud surprise ee jist you come along wi i mr sharpeill show ee where to look and i d low yell be astonished,0
isaac surveyed him for half a minute or so without speaking and then slowly jerked his thumb forwards,0
cut away he said briefly ees i dont mind if i do come but i dont expect to see nothin surprisin at all,0
job grinned derisively for all rejoinder and led the way as requested walking with exaggerated caution and turning his malevolent redbearded face over his shoulder every now and then to make sure that isaac was following the latter shambled along at his usual pace and with a perfectly imperturbable face,0
as they drew near the dell a small cupshaped pit surrounded by bushes at the upper end of the field the sound of voices was distinctly audibletwo voices a mans and a womansspeaking however so low that even when isaac and his companion were close to the brink they could distinguish no words,0
jist step forard mr sharpe sir whispered job excitedly jist look down through the bushes ill bide here till ye come back,0
sharpe paused for a moment or two staring at him with evident displeasure and then went forward presently his tall form towered above the bushes and he looked down into the pit beneath,0
after a long and steady gaze he returned to job took him by the shoulder and propelled him to a safe distance from the tantalising spot job when finally released examined him with great curiosity but the farmers face though a little redder than usual in consequence probably of his recent exertions was stolid as ever,0
well he said in answer to the mans inquiring gaze,0
of course i did mrs fiander was there where i left her and my nevvy was there he ve comed home i see as i axed him,0
oh said job much disappointed i didnt know you were expectin of him,0
did nt ee job i ve been expectin of en all this week im glad hes come,0
it seems a bit queer as he should be in mrs fianders hayfield instead o goin straight to your place urged job almost plaintively it was a little disappointing to find that his great discovery had been anticipated when i did see en bicycling along the road i made sure he must be going straight to you and then when i did see his bicycle leanin agen the hedge i jist thought i d see where he d got toand there he were in the dell,0
and a very natral place for en to be returned isaac in his most matteroffact tone i did tell en most perticlar we was cuttin the church meadow and when he saw mrs fiander in the dell t was most natral he should go and speak to her i dont see nothin queer job hunt,0
he was aholdin o both her hands when i see en muttered job,0
ah commented isaac well hell be aholdin both mine soon i be main glad he be come back now im agoin home to my supper and i think you d do well to go back to yours job ill expect you early in the field tomorrow so the sooner ye get back to look arter your own business the better i would nt advise ee to go interfering wi my nevvy he baint so very fond o folks axin questions or pryin about ah i ve known en take his fists to a man once as he thought too curious t is the way wi young chaps,0
he nodded fixed his eyes impressively on hunt as though to make sure that the meaning of his words had penetrated to that somewhat dullwitted gentlemans consciousness and finally rolled homewards to all appearance placid as ever,0
he had not proceeded very far before he paused however shook his head and finally stood stockstill,0
it now becomes necessary to ascertain what passed before isaac sharpe looking down through the willowbushes descried richard marshall in such close proximity to mrs fiander,0
nothing certainly was farther from rosalies thoughts when she had taken refuge in that sheltered spot from the glare of the afternoon sun than the expectation of the advent of this companion she had in fact quite decided that he was by this time out of the country and had indeed made up her mind to erase his image definitely from her memory henceforward as she frequently told herself she must think only of isaacisaac who had always been her friend who was so soon to be her husband her husbandshe must face the thought though she unconsciously shrank from it oh wouldwould that this sweet cup of forbidden love had never been held to her lips she had dashed it from her but the taste of it remained and had taken all the savour out of her life it had been to her a poisonous cup containing as it did wine from the fruit of the tree of knowledge you know very little of life richard had said to her once alas alas she knew now more than enough,0
oh eliaspoor elias she groaned to herself sometimes why did you die if you had lived i should have known nothingi should have guessed at nothing i might have gone down to my grave without knowing that there was any other love besides that which i gave you,0
as an antidote to the rebellious longing of which she was too often conscious rosalie had recourse to the panacea she had hitherto found unfailing in times of affliction hard work since the writing of that letter to richard and the subsequent battle with herself she had resumed her old energetic habits once more she rose with the dawn once more she passed hours in toil no less arduous than that allotted to her servants she avoided solitude as much as possible and strove by every means in her power to tire herself out,0
so tired was she indeed on this particular afternoon that having sought the friendly shade of the grassy nook already referred to she acknowledged herself to be incapable of further effort even when the great heat had somewhat abated and the retreating voices and heavy tread of her labourers as they trooped homewards warned her that it was growing late she sat on her hands clasping her knees her eyes gazing vacantly on the ground too weary even to think,0
a footstep sounded in the neighbourhood of her retreat but she did not raise her eyes it was some straggler probably hastening to rejoin the others she could hear the bushes rustling as though brushed by a passing form and kept very still she wanted nobody to speak to her nobody even to look at her but now the step faltered haltedthere was a pause and then rapid feet began to descend towards where she sat she raised her eyes first in surprise and a little irritation then in incredulous wonder thenoh what was it that richard saw in them,0
in a moment he was bending over her and both her hands were clasped in his,0
was it that particular moment that job hunt chose to pursue his investigations or did the acknowledged lovers remain thus longer than they knew rosalie could never afterwards tell nor could richard they felt as if they were in a dream time place circumstances were alike forgotten a vague undefined blissthe intangible bliss of dreamshaunted them both and in the minds of both lurked the same dread of awakening,0
it was rosalie who was first recalled to life her eyes which had been fixed on richards face dropped gradually to his hands gazed idly first at those hands then at her own which he was holding then the idea gradually took shape in her mindthose were her hands rosalie fianders hands that were lying in richards clasp and they had no right to be there,0
she snatched them away instantly and the charm was broken,0
you have come back she cried why did you come back,0
her face was white with anguish his on the contrary flushed eager triumphant,0
but did you not find the note which i put in your pocket she murmured gazing at him with frightened eyes i thought you would be sure to find it the other was notwas not really mine i had to write what he wanted,0
i know he answered blithely i could see it plainly enough it was not that which brought me home it was your own precious little notethe little line which laid bare your heart to me i had already sailed before i found it but we touched at queenstown and i landed there and took the first boat home i have travelled night and day since,0
she was shaking like a reed in the wind buti begged you not to come she whispered,0
you begged me not to come sweet and so i guessed i knewyou betrayed your secret my dear love and i felt my own power,0
no no she gasped you must not speak to me like this richardi will not listen you know quite well that i cannot listen i belong to another man,0
but richard bent nearer still his face alight with the same inexplicable triumpha triumph that was almost fierce,0
you belong to me he said and his words were perhaps the more passionate because spoken so low you have belonged to me from the first even from the moment when i saw you in the picture i said to myself,0
oh no pleaded rosalie in tones as passionate as his but infinitely piteous do not say it richarddo notdo not put it into words,0
her hand flew out involuntarily as though to stop his mouth he caught it and kissed it though it fluttered in his grasp,0
why should i not say itwhy should i not be brave enough to put into words the thought which has been in both our minds so often when i saw your picture i fancied myself standing beside you bending over you,0
she had withdrawn her hand and was covering her face,0
i said to myself he persevered his words coming brokenly because of his quick breathing i said to myself if that woman lives she shall be my wifei will search for her until i find her and then when i found youi thought you were free,0
but i was not free she interrupted dropping her hands and looking up with eyes fierce and wild like those of a hunted animal i am not free now neither are you free you are bound to him as much as i amyour duty stares you in the face,0
it is too late to talk of duty i ought never to have seen you do you suppose there is anything which you can tell me that i have not told myself a hundred times he is my uncleyes he has been my benefactor alwaysmore than a father to meyes yes he is the kindest the most warmhearted the most guileless of men it would never enter his honest innocent mind to suspect me of trying to supplant him in acting as i do i am a traitor a liarvile ungrateful dishonourable dishonestoh there are no words strong enough or black enough to paint me as i am i know it and i agree to it but i love you rosalie and i will not give you up,0
some of his words were scarcely audible as they came in gusts from his quivering lips the veins on his forehead stood out there was no mistaking the bitter contempt with which he stigmatised his own conduct but there was even less possibility of misapprehending his deadly earnestness of purpose,0
i mean to have you he went on i mean to let everything goexcept you,0
she was so much taken aback at the suddenness of the onslaught so confounded at the quickness with which he had forestalled all she had intended to urge that she stood before him for a moment absolutely mute trembling moreover with the growing consciousness of her own weakness and at his confident assumption of mastery over her,0
meanwhile he with his eyes fixed upon her face read it like a book his own suddenly changed,0
it is useless to struggle love he said speaking very gently and tenderly we have both done our bestwe have tried to do right but fate has been too strong for us we must just make up our minds to let ourselves go with the tideand be happy,0
rosalie was as has been seen very impressionable very emotionalin a word very womanly but for all that there was at her hearts core the little kernel of strength which is to be found in the hearts of most good womenan instinctive sense of rectitude the love of duty for dutys sake even when the accomplishment of it involves great sacrifice she looked richard full in the face now,0
no she said i will not take any happiness that has to be bought by doing wrong i made my own choice and fixed my lot in life before i knew you and now i will abide by it,0
the very severity of the struggle gave her courage and richard all passionswayed as he was had in him a certain element of chivalrousness that responded to the effort she was making,0
he was silent and rosalie quick to perceive her advantage went on eagerly,0
i ask you to leave me richard i want you to go now it is quite true that you have a kind of power over me and that if youher voice faltered for a moment but she steadied itif you go on urging me and persuading me you will very likely make me give in in the end but i ask you because you love me not to do this we could not be really happy ifif we came together through being dishonourable and ungrateful it is better to do right at all costs as for me i mean to keep my word to your uncle i will try my best to make him a good wife and to forget you,0
and have you thought returned he with a bitterness which he could not controlhave you thought at all of what is to become of me the whole thing is absurd he went on with increasing irritation do you think for a moment that my uncle could suffer a tithe of what i shall suffer you know very well he is not capable of it besides he broke off,0
i know what you mean said rosalie colouring faintly he would not have thought of marrying me if i had not first suggested it but i did suggest it and he is very fond of me now,0
yes as fond as it is in his nature to be he has been faithful to me and i will be faithful to him i will do nothing that could pain or humiliate him some day you too will feel glad that you have not injured your benefactor,0
then what do you want me to do said richard still half sullenly though she saw by his face that her words had struck home,0
i want you to go away nowgo quite away as you intendedas fast as you canbeforebefore anything happens to make us change our minds,0
in the words in her pleading eyes there was that same piteous confession of weakness which had before touched richard and which now roused afresh his most generous instincts,0
i will do what you wish he said you are a good woman rosalie iwill go,0
she glanced at him quickly opened her mouth as if to speak and then turned away without carrying out her intention,0
thus they parted without another word or a clasp of the hands richard climbed up the bank and disappeared from view and rosalie remained standing where he had left her,0
when richard emerged from the shadowy hollow where he had left his mistress standing as if turned to stone he found all the land about him bathed with the rosy glow of sunset the long rollers of newlycut grass over which he stepped were touched here and there by arrows of light and the twigs of the hedge towards which he made his way were outlined as by fire,0
he saw none of these things however but when climbing the low bank and passing through a gap in the hedge he descended into the road he was suddenly recalled to actualities by the unexpected appearance of a colossal figure which seemed to be mounting guard over his bicycle,0
as richard started back farmer sharpe rose from his seat on the bank and stood square and determined before him the ruddy light playing upon his rugged face and shaggy hair and glorifying his white smock one great hand still rested on the saddle of the bicycle which it almost entirely covered as richard remained dumbly gazing at him his fingers began to drum an impatient tune on its smooth surface,0
the young man gazed desperately first at him and then at the bicycle filled with an insane desire to possess himself of it and ride away at full speed but whether because his courage failed him or because nobler and more manly feelings gained the ascendency over this momentary cowardice he did not put the design into execution,0
after gazing steadily at his nephew for what seemed an interminable time isaac removed his hand from the bicycle and pointed in the direction of the little dell,0
i seed ee there richard he remarked in a sepulchral tone i seed ee there with mrs f,0
richard braced himself and looked him full in the face but made no rejoinder,0
ees said the farmer i seed ye both and ive been awaiting here for ye richard,0
still silence richard indeed felt that it would be useless to enter upon either explanation or apology,0
mr sharpes hand crept back to the saddle and resumed its impatient tune he planted his legs a little more widely apart continuing the while to stare unwinkingly in his nephews face,0
when the tension had become almost unbearable he spoke again,0
i thought i d wait for ee here he said i thought ye d very likely have summat to say to me,0
the young man bit his lip and clenched his hands he could scarcely brook the expectant look in those eyes,0
what am i to say uncle isaac iwhat can i say im going away at once,0
the combined effect of sunshine and emotion had already intensified the farmers usually healthy colour but this announcement caused it to deepen to a positively alarming extent for a moment he seemed in danger of suffocation he raised his hand mechanically to the loose collar of his smock and clutched at it his eyes seemed ready to start from their sockets and though he opened his mouth and rolled his head from side to side as though about to fulminate against his nephew no words came,0
dont cried richard much alarmeddont be so angry uncleyou really need nt be so much upset i tell you im going away at oncetonight,0
farmer sharpe sank down on the bank sliding his legs out before him rigid as a pair of compasses his head continued to roll threateningly and his eyes to gaze fiercely at richard but it was some time before he could find voice,0
ye cant go tonight he said at last in husky suffocating tones there baint no train tonight,0
not from branston i know but i mean to ride to wimborne and catch the night train there,0
somehow this catching of the night train at wimborne seemed to be the culminating point of richards depravity isaac positively groaned aloud the fierceness went out of his eyes and to richards infinite distress they filled with tears,0
what more can i do he faltered torn with remorse and grief as he bent over him,0
i did nt think it of ee richardnay if anybody had told me ye d go for to do such a thing i would nt ha believed em to go off wiout a word to ime as has been a father to eenay not so much as a word,0
he paused choked with emotion and fell to wiping his eyes and shaking his head disconsolately while richard slowly straightening himself stood looking down at him,0
when job hunt did call me and did pint out as you was standinyou and mrs fhand in hand both hands in both hands he added correcting himself i didnt let on to take no notice i did send job about his business and i did say to myself ill wait says i my nevvy ull tell me all about it jist now and i did go and sit me down here says i ill not interfere ill wait i says richard will out wi it all to ihell act straight i says hell tell me,0
he spoke almost appealingly richards face which had turned from white to red was now white again,0
i wanted to spare you uncle he murmured at last falteringly,0
isaac groaned and shook his head then drawing a long breath and peering anxiously at his nephew he whispered pleadingly,0
what was you asayin to mrs f when you was aholdin of her hands richard,0
oh groaned the other impatiently there are some things that cant be talked about i should nt have held her handsi scarcely knew that i was holding them what does it matter now we have said goodbye to each other for ever we have made up our minds never to see each other again,0
isaacs jaw dropped he brought down his fist heavily on the bank beside him,0
well he muttered under his breath im danged i cant get no satisfaction not a word,0
you know enough said richard fiercely be content with what i tell youi will never darken your doors again,0
isaac brought down his fist once more on the bank and then slowly hoisted himself on to his feet,0
if ye have nt naught to say to i ive summat to say to you he announced speaking very slowly i baint agoin to let ee go off like that t is my way to be straightforard ill speak my mind plain to ee this night and ill speak my mind to mrs f where be mrs f come along of i richard and find her,0
he had squeezed through the gap in the hedge while still speaking and richard had no choice but to follow him a few strides brought them to the dell and looking down they descried rosalie standing in the same attitude as that in which richard had left her,0
mrs fiander called isaac bending over the brink will ee oblige me by stepping up here the sides be a bit steep and i baint so young as i werei cant very well go down but i d be obliged if you d step up i ve summat to say to you and my nevvy here,0
rosalie had started violently at the sound of his voice and now obeyed his summons in silence but she trembled so much and the wet grass had become so slippery that she stumbled often and it was some time before she completed the ascent meanwhile both men stood watching her motionless and in silence once or twice she had raised her eyes towards the great white figure which awaited her on the brink and it seemed to her that isaacs face was grave and stern like the face of a judge she did not dare once glance at richard but she felt even without looking at him that their secret was discovered,0
the farmer backed a little away from the edge of the dell when rosalie came forth and stood looking from one to the other then he spoke very solemnly and with some hesitation,0
mrs fiander as i was asayin to richard jist now t is best to be straightforardees t is best to speak out even when it be hard to speak out i cant get no satisfaction from richardhe did acshally tell i to my face as he had made up his mind to go straight off wiout a single word to i he comes wiout a word and he goes wiout a word now mrs f i did see you together jist now and i did think as you d have summat to tell me,0
there was a long pause isaac looked once more from rosalies graceful shrinking figure to the other culprit who stood with bent head awaiting the storm of reproach and vituperation,0
from the very first pursued isaac still in that solemn and somewhat stern tone i did tell ee my mind plain mrs fiander i did tell ee straight out did nt i as i had nt never fixed my thoughts on materimony t was you as was set on it,0
oh i know interrupted rosalie i know it too well do not throw it in my face now,0
throw it in your face mrs f whos athrowing o what in your face all i do say is i did alays do my best for eedont you go for to blame me for blame i do not deserve,0
both raised their heads and looked at him astonished at the change of tone for now the old man seemed to speak more in sorrow than in anger,0
i did alays do my best for ee i did alays think and act as kind as i could and you did never once think of i ees i did never interfere he went on more emphatically i left ye both to yourselvesdid nt i i never comed in your way but ye mid ha given me a thought,0
the penitent heads drooped again what need had they to be reminded how guileless he had been how unsuspicious how chivalrous in thought and deed,0
ees went on isaac i did leave ye to yourselvesi did ax ye to make friends do you mind how often i axed ye to be friends,0
true indeed only too true they had taken a base advantage of his confidence they had profited of the opportunities he had given them only to be more and more unfaithful to him in their hearts,0
i thought you d be different to what you do be he continued with increasing severity when samel cross did tell i as you d snap up mrs f richard what did i say says i my nevvy baint a snapper d ye mind i said the same thing to you well i thought maybe you d say summat thenbut not a word,0
uncle iit is nt fair to reproach me like this i kept away from littlecomb as long as i could you know that,0
ees i do know it richardi know it very well you would nt come with me when i did ax ee that sunday you would nt come along o me to littlecomb nay but you went out by yourself that night and when you comed back ye would nt so much as sit down and smoke a pipe like an honest christian and next day you must get up and go off wi yourself before t were light and what did i do thenwhat did i do richard though you d gone off and left me wiout so much as a line i did nt give up hopes of ee yet i went and wrote ee a letter and told ee to come back and all ud be forgive and forgot there now and what do ee say to that,0
his face was working with emotion his voice tremulous for all its strength never in his life probably had isaac sharpe put so many words together and every one of them came from his heart to the young people it seemed as though all their struggles had been futile their good desires vain their great sacrifice useless for all their days they would be branded with infamy they had indeed stopped short of the breach of faith to which both had been so strongly tempted but they had nevertheless violated trust,0
and even now said isaaceven at the very last when you were for cuttin off wiout no explanation i did give ee one more chanceand you would nt take it,0
what in heavens name do you want to say cried richard goaded to desperation do you want me to tell you to your face that i love the woman you are going to marry,0
nay now returned his uncle in an expostulatory tone i would nt go so far as that i baint onreasonable all i did ever think o axin ye was for you and mrs f to see if ye could nt take to each other that were my notion ye might ha gived each other a fair triala fair trial,0
the young couple stared at him blankly hardly believing their ears then richard cried out with a gasp rosalie do you heardo you understand he wanted us to love each other,0
nay interrupted the farmer in a tone that was at once dignified and explanatory i did nt expect so much straight offlove no no not lovebut ye mid ha jist tried to fancy one another ye mid ha had a bit o consideration for me i think ye knowed both on ye as materimony would nt come easy to i and seein as you did tell me plain richard the very first night you come home as you was on the lookout for a wife why not mrs f so well as another,0
it was rosalies turn to gasp now and her face bloomed like a rose in the evening light but neither she nor richard spoke both were so suddenly brought down from their heights of heroics that it was natural they should feel somewhat dizzy and confused,0
im a man o my word said isaac and if ye have made up your mind and fixed your chice on i mrs f whydrawing a deep breathill keep my promise my dear but if richard ud do so well as me t ud be a deal more convenient d ye see it ud seem a bit queer to change my state at my time o life and to leave the old home where i was born and bred and richard he has a very good notion o farmin and he d be willing to carry on the work in the old way and to take advice from i d ye see ah the notion did come to i soon arter he comed here thinks i to myself i wonder if richard ud dot ud be a deal more suitable thinks i and more satisfactory to all parties,0
here isaac was interrupted by a sudden burst of laughter from his nephewlaughter which was indeed the outlet of such an extraordinary mixture of emotions that they had nearly found vent in tears the exquisite sense of relief the unhopedfor joy stirred his very hearts depths but on the other hand the humour of the situation struck him with almost equal force after the overwhelming remorse the bitter sense of shame which but a few moments ago had tortured them to discover that their contemplated sacrifice had very nearly set at naught good old isaacs dearest wish,0
oh uncle uncle he cried as soon as the first ecstatic outburst of mirth had subsided why did you not speak before,0
t would nt ha been very becomin for me to speak returned the farmer still with great dignity i knowed my dooty to mrs f and i were nt agoin to say nothin as mid hurt her feelins but i did try and bring ye together richard and i did try to give ye so many hints as i could d ye mind how often i did say what a dear woman mrs f were and what a good wife she d make ah many a time i did and d ye mind how i used to tell ee it was bad to hurt a womans feelins and you would nt take a bit o pains to be friendly and pleasant wi her i did look for some return from ee richard and i were disappinted and i did expect at least as ye would tell me straight whether you could take to the notion or whether ye could nt t was the least ye mid do i think i were that anxious and that upseti dont see as its any laughin matter he continued with gathering wrath for rosalies face was now dimpling all over with smiles and richards hilarity seemed to increase rather than diminish come ill have a straight answer one way or t other will ye give up this here stupid notion o going out o the country richard and bide here and see if you and mrs f cant make it up between ye and you mrs f my dear will ee jist think over this here matter and see if richard would nt do as well as me,0
will you rosalie he said very gently and tenderly will you try to like me a little,0
and without waiting for an answer he took her hands and laid them softly about his own neck and stooped and kissed her,0
dear heart alive exclaimed isaac clapping his hands that were nt sich a bad beginning richard i will say you baint very slack once you do make a start he paused to laugh long and loud well i never he cried nay richard ye dont do things by halves well mrs f my dear he added more anxiously seeing that rosalie did not speak what d ye say,0
i suppose returned rosalie faintly with her face half hidden on richards shoulder i suppose ill have to try,0
do ee now my dear cried isaac much relieved yell find ye wont repent it and yell not lose nothing by it neither he added as an afterthought richard be jist the same as a son to ihell have all as i ve agot to leave when i be gone i dont want for to seem unkind but it ud be a very great comfort to me if ye could make up your mind tot,0
oh i think murmured rosalie that i can make up my mind to it,0
well then cried isaac chuckling and rubbing his hands alls well as ends well ees we may say thatalls well as ends well well be the best o friends as ever but i do think as richard ull be more suitable as a husband my dear ye mid as well see mrs f home now richard i think ill go back to my bit o supper t will be cold enough by now i reckon,0
with a nod and a broad smile he left them and pursued his homeward way pausing ever and anon to look backwards at the two lithe young figures which moved slowly along above the dark irregular line of hedgethe bent heads very close together outlined against the lambent evening sky once after one of these backward glances he began to chuckle,0
theyve atook to the notion nicely he said ees i reckon theyll do,0
