achine sounding from the farm what did i come in here for what did i want to find my hands were empty perhaps its upstairs then the apples were in the loft and so down again the garden still as ever only the book had slipped into the grass but they had found it in the drawing room not that one could ever see them the window panes reflected apples reflected roses all the leaves were green in the glass if they moved in the drawing room the apple only turned its yellow side yet the moment after if the door was opened spread about the floor hung upon the walls pendant from the ceilingwhat my hands were empty the shadow of a thrush crossed the carpet from the deepest wells of silence the wood pigeon drew its bubble of sound safe safe safe the pulse of the house beat softly the treasure buried the room the pulse stopped short oh was that the buried treasure a moment later the light had faded out in the garden then but the trees spun darkness for a wandering beam o,1

uried treasure the light in the heart a society this is how it all came about six or seven of us were sitting one day after tea some were gazing across the street into the windows of a milliners shop where the light still shone brightly upon scarlet feathers and golden slippers others were idly occupied in building little towers of sugar upon the edge of the tea tray after a time so far as i can remember we drew round the fire and began as usual to praise menhow strong how noble how brilliant how courageous how beautiful they werehow we envied those who by hook or by crook managed to get attached to one for lifewhen poll who had said nothing burst into tears poll i must tell you has always been queer for one thing her father was a strange man he left her a fortune in his will but on condition that she read all the books in the london library we comforted her as best we could but we knew in our hearts how vain it was for though we like her poll is no beauty leaves her sho,1
e laces untied and must have been thinking while we praised men that not one of them would ever wish to marry her at last she dried her tears for some time we could make nothing of what she said strange enough it was in all conscience she told us that as we knew she spent most of her time in the london library reading she had begun she said with english literature on the top floor and was steadily working her way down to the times on the bottom and now half or perhaps only a quarter way through a terrible thing had happened she could read no more books were not what we thought them books she cried rising to her feet and speaking with an intensity of desolation which i shall never forget are for the most part unutterably bad of course we cried out that shakespeare wrote books and milton and shelley oh yes she interrupted us youve been well taught i can see but you are not members of the london library here her sobs broke forth anew at length recovering a little s,1
he opened one of the pile of books which she always carried about with herfrom a window or in a garden or some such name as that it was called and it was written by a man called benton or henson or something of that kind she read the first few pages we listened in silence but thats not a book someone said so she chose another this time it was a history but i have forgotten the writers name our trepidation increased as she went on not a word of it seemed to be true and the style in which it was written was execrable poetry poetry we cried impatiently read us poetry i cannot describe the desolation which fell upon us as she opened a little volume and mouthed out the verbose sentimental foolery which it contained it must have been written by a woman one of us urged but no she told us that it was written by a young man one of the most famous poets of the day i leave you to imagine what the shock of the discovery was though we all cried and begged her to read no more s,1
he persisted and read us extracts from the lives of the lord chancellors when she had finished jane the eldest and wisest of us rose to her feet and said that she for one was not convinced why she asked if men write such rubbish as this should our mothers have wasted their youth in bringing them into the world we were all silent and in the silence poor poll could be heard sobbing out why why did my father teach me to read clorinda was the first to come to her senses its all our fault she said every one of us knows how to read but no one save poll has ever taken the trouble to do it i for one have taken it for granted that it was a womans duty to spend her youth in bearing children i venerated my mother for bearing ten still more my grandmother for bearing fifteen it was i confess my own ambition to bear twenty we have gone on all these ages supposing that men were equally industrious and that their works were of equal merit while we have borne the children they,1
we supposed have borne the books and the pictures we have populated the world they have civilized it but now that we can read what prevents us from judging the results before we bring another child into the world we must swear that we will find out what the world is like so we made ourselves into a society for asking questions one of us was to visit a manofwar another was to hide herself in a scholars study another was to attend a meeting of business men while all were to read books look at pictures go to concerts keep our eyes open in the streets and ask questions perpetually we were very young you can judge of our simplicity when i tell you that before parting that night we agreed that the objects of life were to produce good people and good books our questions were to be directed to finding out how far these objects were now attained by men we vowed solemnly that we would not bear a single child until we were satisfied off we went then some to the british museum others to the ki,1
ngs navy some to oxford others to cambridge we visited the royal academy and the tate heard modern music in concert rooms went to the law courts and saw new plays no one dined out without asking her partner certain questions and carefully noting his replies at intervals we met together and compared our observations oh those were merry meetings never have i laughed so much as i did when rose read her notes upon honour and described how she had dressed herself as an thiopian prince and gone aboard one of his majestys ships discovering the hoax the captain visited her now disguised as a private gentleman and demanded that honour should be satisfied but how she asked how he bellowed with the cane of course seeing that he was beside himself with rage and expecting that her last moment had come she bent over and received to her amazement six light taps upon the behind the honour of the british navy is avenged he cried and raising herself she saw him with the sweat pouring d,1
own his face holding out a trembling right hand away she exclaimed striking an attitude and imitating the ferocity of his own expression my honour has still to be satisfied spoken like a gentleman he returned and fell into profound thought if six strokes avenge the honour of the kings navy he mused how many avenge the honour of a private gentleman he said he would prefer to lay the case before his brother officers she replied haughtily that she could not wait he praised her sensibility let me see he cried suddenly did your father keep a carriage no she said or a riding horse we had a donkey she bethought her which drew the mowing machine at this his face lighted my mothers name she added for gods sake man dont mention your mothers name he shrieked trembling like an aspen and flushing to the roots of his hair and it was ten minutes at least before she could induce him to proceed at length he decreed that if she gave him four strokes and a half i,1
n the small of the back at a spot indicated by himself the half conceded he said in recognition of the fact that her great grandmothers uncle was killed at trafalgar it was his opinion that her honour would be as good as new this was done they retired to a restaurant drank two bottles of wine for which he insisted upon paying and parted with protestations of eternal friendship then we had fannys account of her visit to the law courts at her first visit she had come to the conclusion that the judges were either made of wood or were impersonated by large animals resembling man who had been trained to move with extreme dignity mumble and nod their heads to test her theory she had liberated a handkerchief of bluebottles at the critical moment of a trial but was unable to judge whether the creatures gave signs of humanity for the buzzing of the flies induced so sound a sleep that she only woke in time to see the prisoners led into the cells below but from the evidence she brought we voted that it,1
is unfair to suppose that the judges are men helen went to the royal academy but when asked to deliver her report upon the pictures she began to recite from a pale blue volume o for the touch of a vanished hand and the sound of a voice that is still home is the hunter home from the hill he gave his bridle reins a shake love is sweet love is brief spring the fair spring is the years pleasant king o to be in england now that aprils there men must work and women must weep the path of duty is the way to glory we could listen to no more of this gibberish we want no more poetry we cried daughters of england she began but here we pulled her down a vase of water getting spilt over her in the scuffle thank god she exclaimed shaking herself like a dog now ill roll on the carpet and see if i cant brush off what remains of the union jack then perhaps here she rolled energetically getting up she began to explain to us what modern pictures are like when castalia stopped her,1
what is the average size of a picture she asked perhaps two feet by two and a half she said castalia made notes while helen spoke and when she had done and we were trying not to meet each others eyes rose and said at your wish i spent last week at oxbridge disguised as a charwoman i thus had access to the rooms of several professors and will now attempt to give you some ideaonly she broke off i cant think how to do it its all so queer these professors she went on live in large houses built round grass plots each in a kind of cell by himself yet they have every convenience and comfort you have only to press a button or light a little lamp their papers are beautifully filed books abound there are no children or animals save half a dozen stray cats and one aged bullfincha cock i remember she broke off an aunt of mine who lived at dulwich and kept cactuses you reached the conservatory through the double drawingroom and there on the hot pipes were dozens of them,1
ugly squat bristly little plants each in a separate pot once in a hundred years the aloe flowered so my aunt said but she died before that happened we told her to keep to the point well she resumed when professor hobkin was out i examined his life work an edition of sappho its a queer looking book six or seven inches thick not all by sappho oh no most of it is a defence of sapphos chastity which some german had denied and i can assure you the passion with which these two gentlemen argued the learning they displayed the prodigious ingenuity with which they disputed the use of some implement which looked to me for all the world like a hairpin astounded me especially when the door opened and professor hobkin himself appeared a very nice mild old gentleman but what could he know about chastity we misunderstood her no no she protested hes the soul of honour im surenot that he resembles roses sea captain in the least i was thinking rather of my aunts cactuses wha,1
t could they know about chastity again we told her not to wander from the pointdid the oxbridge professors help to produce good people and good booksthe objects of life there she exclaimed it never struck me to ask it never occurred to me that they could possibly produce anything i believe said sue that you made some mistake probably professor hobkin was a gyncologist a scholar is a very different sort of man a scholar is overflowing with humour and inventionperhaps addicted to wine but what of thata delightful companion generous subtle imaginativeas stands to reason for he spends his life in company with the finest human beings that have ever existed hum said castalia perhaps id better go back and try again some three months later it happened that i was sitting alone when castalia entered i dont know what it was in the look of her that so moved me but i could not restrain myself and dashing across the room i clasped her in my arms not only was she,1
very beautiful she seemed also in the highest spirits how happy you look i exclaimed as she sat down ive been at oxbridge she said asking questions answering them she replied you have not broken our vow i said anxiously noticing something about her figure oh the vow she said casually im going to have a baby if thats what you mean you cant imagine she burst out how exciting how beautiful how satisfying what is i asked totoanswer questions she replied in some confusion whereupon she told me the whole of her story but in the middle of an account which interested and excited me more than anything i had ever heard she gave the strangest cry half whoop half holloa chastity chastity wheres my chastity she cried help ho the scent bottle there was nothing in the room but a cruet containing mustard which i was about to administer when she recovered her composure you should have thought of that three months ago i said severely tr,1
ue she replied theres not much good in thinking of it now it was unfortunate by the way that my mother had me called castalia oh castalia your mother i was beginning when she reached for the mustard pot no no no she said shaking her head if youd been a chaste woman yourself you would have screamed at the sight of meinstead of which you rushed across the room and took me in your arms no cassandra we are neither of us chaste so we went on talking meanwhile the room was filling up for it was the day appointed to discuss the results of our observations everyone i thought felt as i did about castalia they kissed her and said how glad they were to see her again at length when we were all assembled jane rose and said that it was time to begin she began by saying that we had now asked questions for over five years and that though the results were bound to be inconclusivehere castalia nudged me and whispered that she was not so sure about that then she got up and int,1
errupting jane in the middle of a sentence said before you say any more i want to knowam i to stay in the room because she added i have to confess that i am an impure woman everyone looked at her in astonishment you are going to have a baby asked jane she nodded her head it was extraordinary to see the different expressions on their faces a sort of hum went through the room in which i could catch the words impure baby castalia and so on jane who was herself considerably moved put it to us shall she go is she impure such a roar filled the room as might have been heard in the street outside no no no let her stay impure fiddlesticks yet i fancied that some of the youngest girls of nineteen or twenty held back as if overcome with shyness then we all came about her and began asking questions and at last i saw one of the youngest who had kept in the background approach shyly and say to her what is chastity then i mean is it good or is it bad or is i,1
t nothing at all she replied so low that i could not catch what she said you know i was shocked said another for at least ten minutes in my opinion said poll who was growing crusty from always reading in the london library chastity is nothing but ignorancea most discreditable state of mind we should admit only the unchaste to our society i vote that castalia shall be our president this was violently disputed it is as unfair to brand women with chastity as with unchastity said poll some of us havent the opportunity either moreover i dont believe cassy herself maintains that she acted as she did from a pure love of knowledge he is only twentyone and divinely beautiful said cassy with a ravishing gesture i move said helen that no one be allowed to talk of chastity or unchastity save those who are in love oh bother said judith who had been enquiring into scientific matters im not in love and im longing to explain my measures for dispensing with prosti,1
tutes and fertilizing virgins by act of parliament she went on to tell us of an invention of hers to be erected at tube stations and other public resorts which upon payment of a small fee would safeguard the nations health accommodate its sons and relieve its daughters then she had contrived a method of preserving in sealed tubes the germs of future lord chancellors or poets or painters or musicians she went on supposing that is to say that these breeds are not extinct and that women still wish to bear children of course we wish to bear children cried castalia impatiently jane rapped the table that is the very point we are met to consider she said for five years we have been trying to find out whether we are justified in continuing the human race castalia has anticipated our decision but it remains for the rest of us to make up our minds here one after another of our messengers rose and delivered their reports the marvels of civilisation far exceeded our expectations,1
and as we learnt for the first time how man flies in the air talks across space penetrates to the heart of an atom and embraces the universe in his speculations a murmur of admiration burst from our lips we are proud we cried that our mothers sacrificed their youth in such a cause as this castalia who had been listening intently looked prouder than all the rest then jane reminded us that we had still much to learn and castalia begged us to make haste on we went through a vast tangle of statistics we learnt that england has a population of so many millions and that such and such a proportion of them is constantly hungry and in prison that the average size of a working mans family is such and that so great a percentage of women die from maladies incident to childbirth reports were read of visits to factories shops slums and dockyards descriptions were given of the stock exchange of a gigantic house of business in the city and of a government office the british colonies were now,1
discussed and some account was given of our rule in india africa and ireland i was sitting by castalia and i noticed her uneasiness we shall never come to any conclusion at all at this rate she said as it appears that civilisation is so much more complex than we had any notion would it not be better to confine ourselves to our original enquiry we agreed that it was the object of life to produce good people and good books all this time we have been talking of aeroplanes factories and money let us talk about men themselves and their arts for that is the heart of the matter so the diners out stepped forward with long slips of paper containing answers to their questions these had been framed after much consideration a good man we had agreed must at any rate be honest passionate and unworldly but whether or not a particular man possessed those qualities could only be discovered by asking questions often beginning at a remote distance from the centre is kensington a nice place to live i,1
n where is your son being educatedand your daughter now please tell me what do you pay for your cigars by the way is sir joseph a baronet or only a knight often it seemed that we learnt more from trivial questions of this kind than from more direct ones i accepted my peerage said lord bunkum because my wife wished it i forget how many titles were accepted for the same reason working fifteen hours out of the twentyfour as i do ten thousand professional men began no no of course you can neither read nor write but why do you work so hard my dear lady with a growing family but why does your family grow their wives wished that too or perhaps it was the british empire but more significant than the answers were the refusals to answer very few would reply at all to questions about morality and religion and such answers as were given were not serious questions as to the value of money and power were almost invariably brushed aside or pressed at extreme risk to the ask,1
er im sure said jill that if sir harley tightboots hadnt been carving the mutton when i asked him about the capitalist system he would have cut my throat the only reason why we escaped with our lives over and over again is that men are at once so hungry and so chivalrous they despise us too much to mind what we say of course they despise us said eleanor at the same time how do you account for thisi made enquiries among the artists now no woman has ever been an artist has she poll janeaustencharlottebrontgeorgeeliot cried poll like a man crying muffins in a back street damn the woman someone exclaimed what a bore she is since sappho there has been no female of first rate eleanor began quoting from a weekly newspaper its now well known that sappho was the somewhat lewd invention of professor hobkin ruth interrupted anyhow there is no reason to suppose that any woman ever has been able to write or ever will be able to write eleanor continued and,1
yet whenever i go among authors they never cease to talk to me about their books masterly i say or shakespeare himself for one must say something and i assure you they believe me that proves nothing said jane they all do it only she sighed it doesnt seem to help us much perhaps we had better examine modern literature next liz its your turn elizabeth rose and said that in order to prosecute her enquiry she had dressed as a man and been taken for a reviewer i have read new books pretty steadily for the past five years said she mr wells is the most popular living writer then comes mr arnold bennett then mr compton mackenzie mr mckenna and mr walpole may be bracketed together she sat down but youve told us nothing we expostulated or do you mean that these gentlemen have greatly surpassed janeelliot and that english fiction iswheres that review of yours oh yes safe in their hands safe quite safe she said shifting uneasily from foot to foot,1
and im sure that they give away even more than they receive we were all sure of that but we pressed her do they write good books good books she said looking at the ceiling you must remember she began speaking with extreme rapidity that fiction is the mirror of life and you cant deny that education is of the highest importance and that it would be extremely annoying if you found yourself alone at brighton late at night not to know which was the best boarding house to stay at and suppose it was a dripping sunday eveningwouldnt it be nice to go to the movies but what has that got to do with it we asked nothingnothingnothing whatever she replied well tell us the truth we bade her the truth but isnt it wonderful she broke offmr chitter has written a weekly article for the past thirty years upon love or hot buttered toast and has sent all his sons to eton the truth we demanded oh the truth she stammered the truth has nothing to do,1
with literature and sitting down she refused to say another word it all seemed to us very inconclusive ladies we must try to sum up the results jane was beginning when a hum which had been heard for some time through the open window drowned her voice war war war declaration of war men were shouting in the street below we looked at each other in horror what war we cried what war we remembered too late that we had never thought of sending anyone to the house of commons we had forgotten all about it we turned to poll who had reached the history shelves in the london library and asked her to enlighten us why we cried do men go to war sometimes for one reason sometimes for another she replied calmly in for example the shouts outside drowned her words again in in it was the austrians in was the francoprussianin on the other hand but its now we cut her short ah i dont know what theyre going to war f,1
or now she admitted the war was over and peace was in process of being signed when i once more found myself with castalia in the room where our meetings used to be held we began idly turning over the pages of our old minute books queer i mused to see what we were thinking five years ago we are agreed castalia quoted reading over my shoulder that it is the object of life to produce good people and good books we made no comment upon that a good man is at any rate honest passionate and unworldly what a womans language i observed oh dear cried castalia pushing the book away from her what fools we were it was all polls fathers fault she went on i believe he did it on purposethat ridiculous will i mean forcing poll to read all the books in the london library if we hadnt learnt to read she said bitterly we might still have been bearing children in ignorance and that i believe was the happiest life after all i know wh,1
at youre going to say about war she checked me and the horror of bearing children to see them killed but our mothers did it and their mothers and their mothers before them and they didnt complain they couldnt read ive done my best she sighed to prevent my little girl from learning to read but whats the use i caught ann only yesterday with a newspaper in her hand and she was beginning to ask me if it was true next shell ask me whether mr lloyd george is a good man then whether mr arnold bennett is a good novelist and finally whether i believe in god how can i bring my daughter up to believe in nothing she demanded surely you could teach her to believe that a mans intellect is and always will be fundamentally superior to a womans i suggested she brightened at this and began to turn over our old minutes again yes she said think of their discoveries their mathematics their science their philosophy their scholarship and then she began to laugh i shall ne,1
ver forget old hobkin and the hairpin she said and went on reading and laughing and i thought she was quite happy when suddenly she drew the book from her and burst out oh cassandra why do you torment me dont you know that our belief in mans intellect is the greatest fallacy of them all what i exclaimed ask any journalist schoolmaster politician or public house keeper in the land and they will all tell you that men are much cleverer than women as if i doubted it she said scornfully how could they help it havent we bred them and fed and kept them in comfort since the beginning of time so that they may be clever even if theyre nothing else its all our doing she cried we insisted upon having intellect and now weve got it and its intellect she continued thats at the bottom of it what could be more charming than a boy before he has begun to cultivate his intellect he is beautiful to look at he gives himself no airs he understands the meaning of art and literature ins,1

t occupation we shall get neither good people nor good books we shall perish beneath the fruits of their unbridled activity and not a human being will survive to know that there once was shakespeare it is too late i replied we cannot provide even for the children that we have and then you ask me to believe in intellect she said while we spoke men were crying hoarsely and wearily in the street and listening we heard that the treaty of peace had just been signed the voices died away the rain was falling and interfered no doubt with the proper explosion of the fireworks my cook will have bought the evening news said castalia and ann will be spelling it out over her tea i must go home its no goodnot a bit of good i said once she knows how to read theres only one thing you can teach her to believe inand that is herself well that would be a change sighed castalia so we swept up the papers of our society and though ann was playing with her doll very happily w,1

to side until like a top exhausted with spinning it settled on her neck the times was no protection against such sorrow as hers but other human beings forbade intercourse the best thing to do against life was to fold the paper so that it made a perfect square crisp thick impervious even to life this done i glanced up quickly armed with a shield of my own she pierced through my shield she gazed into my eyes as if searching any sediment of courage at the depths of them and damping it to clay her twitch alone denied all hope discounted all illusion so we rattled through surrey and across the border into sussex but with my eyes upon life i did not see that the other travellers had left one by one till save for the man who read we were alone together here was three bridges station we drew slowly down the platform and stopped was he going to leave us i prayed both waysi prayed last that he might stay at that instant he roused himself crumpled his paper contemptuously like a thing,1
done with burst open the door and left us alone the unhappy woman leaning a little forward palely and colourlessly addressed metalked of stations and holidays of brothers at eastbourne and the time of year which was i forget now early or late but at last looking from the window and seeing i knew only life she breathed staying awaythats the drawback of it ah now we approached the catastrophe my sisterinlawthe bitterness of her tone was like lemon on cold steel and speaking not to me but to herself she muttered nonsense she would saythats what they all say and while she spoke she fidgeted as though the skin on her back were as a plucked fowls in a poulterers shopwindow oh that cow she broke off nervously as though the great wooden cow in the meadow had shocked her and saved her from some indiscretion then she shuddered and then she made the awkward angular movement that i had seen before as if after the spasm some spot between the shoulders burnt or,1

lled the parasol out of the earth with a jerk and was impatient to find the place where one had tea with other people like other people come along trissie its time we had our tea wherever does one have ones tea she asked with the oddest thrill of excitement in her voice looking vaguely round and letting herself be drawn on down the grass path trailing her parasol turning her head this way and that way forgetting her tea wishing to go down there and then down there remembering orchids and cranes among wild flowers a chinese pagoda and a crimson crested bird but he bore her on thus one couple after another with much the same irregular and aimless movement passed the flowerbed and were enveloped in layer after layer of green blue vapour in which at first their bodies had substance and a dash of colour but later both substance and colour dissolved in the greenblue atmosphere how hot it was so hot that even the thrush chose to hop like a mechanical bird in the shadow of the flower,1
s with long pauses between one movement and the next instead of rambling vaguely the white butterflies danced one above another making with their white shifting flakes the outline of a shattered marble column above the tallest flowers the glass roofs of the palm house shone as if a whole market full of shiny green umbrellas had opened in the sun and in the drone of the aeroplane the voice of the summer sky murmured its fierce soul yellow and black pink and snow white shapes of all these colours men women and children were spotted for a second upon the horizon and then seeing the breadth of yellow that lay upon the grass they wavered and sought shade beneath the trees dissolving like drops of water in the yellow and green atmosphere staining it faintly with red and blue it seemed as if all gross and heavy bodies had sunk down in the heat motionless and lay huddled upon the ground but their voices went wavering from them as if they were flames lolling from the thick waxen bodies of candles vo,1
ices yes voices wordless voices breaking the silence suddenly with such depth of contentment such passion of desire or in the voices of children such freshness of surprise breaking the silence but there was no silence all the time the motor omnibuses were turning their wheels and changing their gear like a vast nest of chinese boxes all of wrought steel turning ceaselessly one within another the city murmured on the top of which the voices cried aloud and the petals of myriads of flowers flashed their colours into the air the mark on the wall perhaps it was the middle of january in the present year that i first looked up and saw the mark on the wall in order to fix a date it is necessary to remember what one saw so now i think of the fire the steady film of yellow light upon the page of my book the three chrysanthemums in the round glass bowl on the mantelpiece yes it must have been the winter time and we had just finished our tea for i remember that i was smoking a cigarette when,1
i looked up and saw the mark on the wall for the first time i looked up through the smoke of my cigarette and my eye lodged for a moment upon the burning coals and that old fancy of the crimson flag flapping from the castle tower came into my mind and i thought of the cavalcade of red knights riding up the side of the black rock rather to my relief the sight of the mark interrupted the fancy for it is an old fancy an automatic fancy made as a child perhaps the mark was a small round mark black upon the white wall about six or seven inches above the mantelpiece how readily our thoughts swarm upon a new object lifting it a little way as ants carry a blade of straw so feverishly and then leave it if that mark was made by a nail it cant have been for a picture it must have been for a miniaturethe miniature of a lady with white powdered curls powderdusted cheeks and lips like red carnations a fraud of course for the people who had this house before us would have chosen pictures in that,1
wayan old picture for an old room that is the sort of people they werevery interesting people and i think of them so often in such queer places because one will never see them again never know what happened next they wanted to leave this house because they wanted to change their style of furniture so he said and he was in process of saying that in his opinion art should have ideas behind it when we were torn asunder as one is torn from the old lady about to pour out tea and the young man about to hit the tennis ball in the back garden of the suburban villa as one rushes past in the train but as for that mark im not sure about it i dont believe it was made by a nail after all its too big too round for that i might get up but if i got up and looked at it ten to one i shouldnt be able to say for certain because once a things done no one ever knows how it happened oh dear me the mystery of life the inaccuracy of thought the ignorance of humanity to show how very little control,1

t office with ones hair flying back like the tail of a racehorse yes that seems to express the rapidity of life the perpetual waste and repair all so casual all so haphazard but after life the slow pulling down of thick green stalks so that the cup of the flower as it turns over deluges one with purple and red light why after all should one not be born there as one is born here helpless speechless unable to focus ones eyesight groping at the roots of the grass at the toes of the giants as for saying which are trees and which are men and women or whether there are such things that one wont be in a condition to do for fifty years or so there will be nothing but spaces of light and dark intersected by thick stalks and rather higher up perhaps roseshaped blots of an indistinct colourdim pinks and blueswhich will as time goes on become more definite becomei dont know what and yet that mark on the wall is not a hole at all it may even be caused by some round black,1

explore those the phantoms they will pursue leaving the description of reality more and more out of their stories taking a knowledge of it for granted as the greeks did and shakespeare perhapsbut these generalizations are very worthless the military sound of the word is enough it recalls leading articles cabinet ministersa whole class of things indeed which as a child one thought the thing itself the standard thing the real thing from which one could not depart save at the risk of nameless damnation generalizations bring back somehow sunday in london sunday afternoon walks sunday luncheons and also ways of speaking of the dead clothes and habitslike the habit of sitting all together in one room until a certain hour although nobody liked it there was a rule for everything the rule for tablecloths at that particular period was that they should be made of tapestry with little yellow compartments marked upon them such as you may see in photographs of the carpets in the corridors of the r,1

before his fathers final resignation and acceptance of an earldom his way of life was made easy to him as usher of the exchequer comptroller of the pipe and clerk of the estreats in the exchequer he received nearly two thousand a year for doing nothing lived with his father and amused himself horace walpole idled and amused himself with the small life of the fashionable world to which he was proud of belonging though he had a quick eye for its vanities he had social wit and liked to put it to small uses but he was not an empty idler and there were seasons when he could become a sharp judge of himself i am sensible he wrote to his most intimate friend i am sensible of having more follies and weaknesses and fewer real good qualities than most men i sometimes reflect on this though i own too seldom i always want to begin acting like a man and a sensible one which i think i might be if i would he had deep home affections and under many polite affectations plenty of good sense,2
horace walpoles father died in the eldest son who succeeded to the earldom died in and left a son george who was for a time insane and lived until as george left no child the title and estates passed to horace walpole then seventyfour years old and the only uncle who survived horace walpole thus became earl of orford during the last six years of his life as to the title he said that he felt himself being called names in his old age he died unmarried in the year at the age of eighty he had turned his house at strawberry hill by the thames near twickenham into a gothic villaeighteenthcentury gothicand amused himself by spending freely upon its adornment with such things as were then fashionable as objects of taste but he delighted also in his flowers and his trellises of roses and the quiet thames when confined by gout to his london house in arlington street flowers from strawberry hill and a bird were necessary consolations he set up also at strawberry hill,2
a private printing press at which he printed his friend grays poems also in his own catalogue of the royal and noble authors of england and five volumes of anecdotes of painting in england between and horace walpole produced the castle of otranto in at the mature age of fortyeight it was suggested by a dream from which he said he waked one morning and of which all i could recover was that i had thought myself in an ancient castle a very natural dream for a head like mine filled with gothic story and that on the uppermost banister of a great staircase i saw a gigantic hand in armour in the evening i sat down and began to write without knowing in the least what i intended to say or relate so began the tale which professed to be translated by william marshal gentleman from the italian of onuphro muralto canon of the church of st nicholas at otranto it was written in two months walpoles friend gray reported to him that at cambridge the book made some of th,2
em cry a little and all in general afraid to go to bed o nights the castle of otranto was in its own way an early sign of the reaction towards romance in the latter part of the last century this gives it interest but it has had many followers and the hardy modern reader when he reads grays note from cambridge needs to be reminded of its date h m preface to the first edition the following work was found in the library of an ancient catholic family in the north of england it was printed at naples in the black letter in the year how much sooner it was written does not appear the principal incidents are such as were believed in the darkest ages of christianity but the language and conduct have nothing that savours of barbarism the style is the purest italian if the story was written near the time when it is supposed to have happened it must have been between the era of the first crusade and the date of the last or not long afterwards there is no other circum,2
stance in the work that can lead us to guess at the period in which the scene is laid the names of the actors are evidently fictitious and probably disguised on purpose yet the spanish names of the domestics seem to indicate that this work was not composed until the establishment of the arragonian kings in naples had made spanish appellations familiar in that country the beauty of the diction and the zeal of the author moderated however by singular judgment concur to make me think that the date of the composition was little antecedent to that of the impression letters were then in their most flourishing state in italy and contributed to dispel the empire of superstition at that time so forcibly attacked by the reformers it is not unlikely that an artful priest might endeavour to turn their own arms on the innovators and might avail himself of his abilities as an author to confirm the populace in their ancient errors and superstitions if this was his view he has certainly acted with signal addr,2
ess such a work as the following would enslave a hundred vulgar minds beyond half the books of controversy that have been written from the days of luther to the present hour this solution of the authors motives is however offered as a mere conjecture whatever his views were or whatever effects the execution of them might have his work can only be laid before the public at present as a matter of entertainment even as such some apology for it is necessary miracles visions necromancy dreams and other preternatural events are exploded now even from romances that was not the case when our author wrote much less when the story itself is supposed to have happened belief in every kind of prodigy was so established in those dark ages that an author would not be faithful to the manners of the times who should omit all mention of them he is not bound to believe them himself but he must represent his actors as believing them if this air of the miraculous is excused the reader will find nothing,2
else unworthy of his perusal allow the possibility of the facts and all the actors comport themselves as persons would do in their situation there is no bombast no similes flowers digressions or unnecessary descriptions everything tends directly to the catastrophe never is the readers attention relaxed the rules of the drama are almost observed throughout the conduct of the piece the characters are well drawn and still better maintained terror the authors principal engine prevents the story from ever languishing and it is so often contrasted by pity that the mind is kept up in a constant vicissitude of interesting passions some persons may perhaps think the characters of the domestics too little serious for the general cast of the story but besides their opposition to the principal personages the art of the author is very observable in his conduct of the subalterns they discover many passages essential to the story which could not be well brought to light but by their navet and si,2
mplicity in particular the womanish terror and foibles of bianca in the last chapter conduce essentially towards advancing the catastrophe it is natural for a translator to be prejudiced in favour of his adopted work more impartial readers may not be so much struck with the beauties of this piece as i was yet i am not blind to my authors defects i could wish he had grounded his plan on a more useful moral than this that the sins of fathers are visited on their children to the third and fourth generation i doubt whether in his time any more than at present ambition curbed its appetite of dominion from the dread of so remote a punishment and yet this moral is weakened by that less direct insinuation that even such anathema may be diverted by devotion to st nicholas here the interest of the monk plainly gets the better of the judgment of the author however with all its faults i have no doubt but the english reader will be pleased with a sight of this performance the piety that reigns thr,2
oughout the lessons of virtue that are inculcated and the rigid purity of the sentiments exempt this work from the censure to which romances are but too liable should it meet with the success i hope for i may be encouraged to reprint the original italian though it will tend to depreciate my own labour our language falls far short of the charms of the italian both for variety and harmony the latter is peculiarly excellent for simple narrative it is difficult in english to relate without falling too low or rising too high a fault obviously occasioned by the little care taken to speak pure language in common conversation every italian or frenchman of any rank piques himself on speaking his own tongue correctly and with choice i cannot flatter myself with having done justice to my author in this respect his style is as elegant as his conduct of the passions is masterly it is a pity that he did not apply his talents to what they were evidently proper forthe theatre i will detain the reader no lon,2
ger but to make one short remark though the machinery is invention and the names of the actors imaginary i cannot but believe that the groundwork of the story is founded on truth the scene is undoubtedly laid in some real castle the author seems frequently without design to describe particular parts the chamber says he on the right hand the door on the left hand the distance from the chapel to conrads apartment these and other passages are strong presumptions that the author had some certain building in his eye curious persons who have leisure to employ in such researches may possibly discover in the italian writers the foundation on which our author has built if a catastrophe at all resembling that which he describes is believed to have given rise to this work it will contribute to interest the reader and will make the castle of otranto a still more moving story sonnet to the right honourable lady mary coke the gentle maid whose hapless tale these melancholy page,2

h would permit manfreds impatience for this ceremonial was remarked by his family and neighbours the former indeed apprehending the severity of their princes disposition did not dare to utter their surmises on this precipitation hippolita his wife an amiable lady did sometimes venture to represent the danger of marrying their only son so early considering his great youth and greater infirmities but she never received any other answer than reflections on her own sterility who had given him but one heir his tenants and subjects were less cautious in their discourses they attributed this hasty wedding to the princes dread of seeing accomplished an ancient prophecy which was said to have pronounced that the castle and lordship of otranto should pass from the present family whenever the real owner should be grown too large to inhabit it it was difficult to make any sense of this prophecy and still less easy to conceive what it had to do with the marriage in question yet these mysteries o,2
r contradictions did not make the populace adhere the less to their opinion young conrads birthday was fixed for his espousals the company was assembled in the chapel of the castle and everything ready for beginning the divine office when conrad himself was missing manfred impatient of the least delay and who had not observed his son retire despatched one of his attendants to summon the young prince the servant who had not stayed long enough to have crossed the court to conrads apartment came running back breathless in a frantic manner his eyes staring and foaming at the mouth he said nothing but pointed to the court the company were struck with terror and amazement the princess hippolita without knowing what was the matter but anxious for her son swooned away manfred less apprehensive than enraged at the procrastination of the nuptials and at the folly of his domestic asked imperiously what was the matter the fellow made no answer but continued pointing towards the courtyard,2
and at last after repeated questions put to him cried out oh the helmet the helmet in the meantime some of the company had run into the court from whence was heard a confused noise of shrieks horror and surprise manfred who began to be alarmed at not seeing his son went himself to get information of what occasioned this strange confusion matilda remained endeavouring to assist her mother and isabella stayed for the same purpose and to avoid showing any impatience for the bridegroom for whom in truth she had conceived little affection the first thing that struck manfreds eyes was a group of his servants endeavouring to raise something that appeared to him a mountain of sable plumes he gazed without believing his sight what are ye doing cried manfred wrathfully where is my son a volley of voices replied oh my lord the prince the prince the helmet the helmet shocked with these lamentable sounds and dreading he knew not what he advanced hastilybut what a sight fo,2
r a fathers eyeshe beheld his child dashed to pieces and almost buried under an enormous helmet an hundred times more large than any casque ever made for human being and shaded with a proportionable quantity of black feathers the horror of the spectacle the ignorance of all around how this misfortune had happened and above all the tremendous phenomenon before him took away the princes speech yet his silence lasted longer than even grief could occasion he fixed his eyes on what he wished in vain to believe a vision and seemed less attentive to his loss than buried in meditation on the stupendous object that had occasioned it he touched he examined the fatal casque nor could even the bleeding mangled remains of the young prince divert the eyes of manfred from the portent before him all who had known his partial fondness for young conrad were as much surprised at their princes insensibility as thunderstruck themselves at the miracle of the helmet they conveyed the disfigured corpse into,2
the hall without receiving the least direction from manfred as little was he attentive to the ladies who remained in the chapel on the contrary without mentioning the unhappy princesses his wife and daughter the first sounds that dropped from manfreds lips were take care of the lady isabella the domestics without observing the singularity of this direction were guided by their affection to their mistress to consider it as peculiarly addressed to her situation and flew to her assistance they conveyed her to her chamber more dead than alive and indifferent to all the strange circumstances she heard except the death of her son matilda who doted on her mother smothered her own grief and amazement and thought of nothing but assisting and comforting her afflicted parent isabella who had been treated by hippolita like a daughter and who returned that tenderness with equal duty and affection was scarce less assiduous about the princess at the same time endeavouring to partake and lessen,2
the weight of sorrow which she saw matilda strove to suppress for whom she had conceived the warmest sympathy of friendship yet her own situation could not help finding its place in her thoughts she felt no concern for the death of young conrad except commiseration and she was not sorry to be delivered from a marriage which had promised her little felicity either from her destined bridegroom or from the severe temper of manfred who though he had distinguished her by great indulgence had imprinted her mind with terror from his causeless rigour to such amiable princesses as hippolita and matilda while the ladies were conveying the wretched mother to her bed manfred remained in the court gazing on the ominous casque and regardless of the crowd which the strangeness of the event had now assembled around him the few words he articulated tended solely to inquiries whether any man knew from whence it could have come nobody could give him the least information however as it seemed to be the sole,2
object of his curiosity it soon became so to the rest of the spectators whose conjectures were as absurd and improbable as the catastrophe itself was unprecedented in the midst of their senseless guesses a young peasant whom rumour had drawn thither from a neighbouring village observed that the miraculous helmet was exactly like that on the figure in black marble of alfonso the good one of their former princes in the church of st nicholas villain what sayest thou cried manfred starting from his trance in a tempest of rage and seizing the young man by the collar how darest thou utter such treason thy life shall pay for it the spectators who as little comprehended the cause of the princes fury as all the rest they had seen were at a loss to unravel this new circumstance the young peasant himself was still more astonished not conceiving how he had offended the prince yet recollecting himself with a mixture of grace and humility he disengaged himself from manfreds grip and then,2
with an obeisance which discovered more jealousy of innocence than dismay he asked with respect of what he was guilty manfred more enraged at the vigour however decently exerted with which the young man had shaken off his hold than appeased by his submission ordered his attendants to seize him and if he had not been withheld by his friends whom he had invited to the nuptials would have poignarded the peasant in their arms during this altercation some of the vulgar spectators had run to the great church which stood near the castle and came back openmouthed declaring that the helmet was missing from alfonsos statue manfred at this news grew perfectly frantic and as if he sought a subject on which to vent the tempest within him he rushed again on the young peasant crying villain monster sorcerer tis thou hast done this tis thou hast slain my son the mob who wanted some object within the scope of their capacities on whom they might discharge their bewildered reasoning ca,2
ught the words from the mouth of their lord and reechoed ay ay tis he tis he he has stolen the helmet from good alfonsos tomb and dashed out the brains of our young prince with it never reflecting how enormous the disproportion was between the marble helmet that had been in the church and that of steel before their eyes nor how impossible it was for a youth seemingly not twenty to wield a piece of armour of so prodigious a weight the folly of these ejaculations brought manfred to himself yet whether provoked at the peasant having observed the resemblance between the two helmets and thereby led to the farther discovery of the absence of that in the church or wishing to bury any such rumour under so impertinent a supposition he gravely pronounced that the young man was certainly a necromancer and that till the church could take cognisance of the affair he would have the magician whom they had thus detected kept prisoner under the helmet itself which he ordered his attendants to rais,2
e and place the young man under it declaring he should be kept there without food with which his own infernal art might furnish him it was in vain for the youth to represent against this preposterous sentence in vain did manfreds friends endeavour to divert him from this savage and illgrounded resolution the generality were charmed with their lords decision which to their apprehensions carried great appearance of justice as the magician was to be punished by the very instrument with which he had offended nor were they struck with the least compunction at the probability of the youth being starved for they firmly believed that by his diabolic skill he could easily supply himself with nutriment manfred thus saw his commands even cheerfully obeyed and appointing a guard with strict orders to prevent any food being conveyed to the prisoner he dismissed his friends and attendants and retired to his own chamber after locking the gates of the castle in which he suffered none but his domestic,2
s to remain in the meantime the care and zeal of the young ladies had brought the princess hippolita to herself who amidst the transports of her own sorrow frequently demanded news of her lord would have dismissed her attendants to watch over him and at last enjoined matilda to leave her and visit and comfort her father matilda who wanted no affectionate duty to manfred though she trembled at his austerity obeyed the orders of hippolita whom she tenderly recommended to isabella and inquiring of the domestics for her father was informed that he was retired to his chamber and had commanded that nobody should have admittance to him concluding that he was immersed in sorrow for the death of her brother and fearing to renew his tears by the sight of his sole remaining child she hesitated whether she should break in upon his affliction yet solicitude for him backed by the commands of her mother encouraged her to venture disobeying the orders he had given a fault she had never been guilty of be,2
fore the gentle timidity of her nature made her pause for some minutes at his door she heard him traverse his chamber backwards and forwards with disordered steps a mood which increased her apprehensions she was however just going to beg admittance when manfred suddenly opened the door and as it was now twilight concurring with the disorder of his mind he did not distinguish the person but asked angrily who it was matilda replied trembling my dearest father it is i your daughter manfred stepping back hastily cried begone i do not want a daughter and flinging back abruptly clapped the door against the terrified matilda she was too well acquainted with her fathers impetuosity to venture a second intrusion when she had a little recovered the shock of so bitter a reception she wiped away her tears to prevent the additional stab that the knowledge of it would give to hippolita who questioned her in the most anxious terms on the health of manfred and how he bore his loss mati,2
lda assured her he was well and supported his misfortune with manly fortitude but will he not let me see him said hippolita mournfully will he not permit me to blend my tears with his and shed a mothers sorrows in the bosom of her lord or do you deceive me matilda i know how manfred doted on his son is not the stroke too heavy for him has he not sunk under it you do not answer mealas i dread the worstraise me my maidens i will i will see my lord bear me to him instantly he is dearer to me even than my children matilda made signs to isabella to prevent hippolitas rising and both those lovely young women were using their gentle violence to stop and calm the princess when a servant on the part of manfred arrived and told isabella that his lord demanded to speak with her with me cried isabella go said hippolita relieved by a message from her lord manfred cannot support the sight of his own family he thinks you less disordered than we are and dreads the shock of my g,2

e portrait of his grandfather which hung over the bench where they had been sitting uttered a deep sigh and heaved its breast isabella whose back was turned to the picture saw not the motion nor knew whence the sound came but started and said hark my lord what sound was that and at the same time made towards the door manfred distracted between the flight of isabella who had now reached the stairs and yet unable to keep his eyes from the picture which began to move had however advanced some steps after her still looking backwards on the portrait when he saw it quit its panel and descend on the floor with a grave and melancholy air do i dream cried manfred returning or are the devils themselves in league against me speak infernal spectre or if thou art my grandsire why dost thou too conspire against thy wretched descendant who too dearly pays for ere he could finish the sentence the vision sighed again and made a sign to manfred to follow him lead on cried man,2
fred i will follow thee to the gulf of perdition the spectre marched sedately but dejected to the end of the gallery and turned into a chamber on the right hand manfred accompanied him at a little distance full of anxiety and horror but resolved as he would have entered the chamber the door was clapped to with violence by an invisible hand the prince collecting courage from this delay would have forcibly burst open the door with his foot but found that it resisted his utmost efforts since hell will not satisfy my curiosity said manfred i will use the human means in my power for preserving my race isabella shall not escape me the lady whose resolution had given way to terror the moment she had quitted manfred continued her flight to the bottom of the principal staircase there she stopped not knowing whither to direct her steps nor how to escape from the impetuosity of the prince the gates of the castle she knew were locked and guards placed in the court should she as her,2
heart prompted her go and prepare hippolita for the cruel destiny that awaited her she did not doubt but manfred would seek her there and that his violence would incite him to double the injury he meditated without leaving room for them to avoid the impetuosity of his passions delay might give him time to reflect on the horrid measures he had conceived or produce some circumstance in her favour if she couldfor that night at leastavoid his odious purpose yet where conceal herself how avoid the pursuit he would infallibly make throughout the castle as these thoughts passed rapidly through her mind she recollected a subterraneous passage which led from the vaults of the castle to the church of st nicholas could she reach the altar before she was overtaken she knew even manfreds violence would not dare to profane the sacredness of the place and she determined if no other means of deliverance offered to shut herself up for ever among the holy virgins whose convent was contiguous to the cathed,2
ral in this resolution she seized a lamp that burned at the foot of the staircase and hurried towards the secret passage the lower part of the castle was hollowed into several intricate cloisters and it was not easy for one under so much anxiety to find the door that opened into the cavern an awful silence reigned throughout those subterraneous regions except now and then some blasts of wind that shook the doors she had passed and which grating on the rusty hinges were reechoed through that long labyrinth of darkness every murmur struck her with new terror yet more she dreaded to hear the wrathful voice of manfred urging his domestics to pursue her she trod as softly as impatience would give her leave yet frequently stopped and listened to hear if she was followed in one of those moments she thought she heard a sigh she shuddered and recoiled a few paces in a moment she thought she heard the step of some person her blood curdled she concluded it was manfred every suggestion that horror,2
could inspire rushed into her mind she condemned her rash flight which had thus exposed her to his rage in a place where her cries were not likely to draw anybody to her assistance yet the sound seemed not to come from behind if manfred knew where she was he must have followed her she was still in one of the cloisters and the steps she had heard were too distinct to proceed from the way she had come cheered with this reflection and hoping to find a friend in whoever was not the prince she was going to advance when a door that stood ajar at some distance to the left was opened gently but ere her lamp which she held up could discover who opened it the person retreated precipitately on seeing the light isabella whom every incident was sufficient to dismay hesitated whether she should proceed her dread of manfred soon outweighed every other terror the very circumstance of the person avoiding her gave her a sort of courage it could only be she thought some domestic belonging to the castl,2
e her gentleness had never raised her an enemy and conscious innocence made her hope that unless sent by the princes order to seek her his servants would rather assist than prevent her flight fortifying herself with these reflections and believing by what she could observe that she was near the mouth of the subterraneous cavern she approached the door that had been opened but a sudden gust of wind that met her at the door extinguished her lamp and left her in total darkness words cannot paint the horror of the princesss situation alone in so dismal a place her mind imprinted with all the terrible events of the day hopeless of escaping expecting every moment the arrival of manfred and far from tranquil on knowing she was within reach of somebody she knew not whom who for some cause seemed concealed thereabouts all these thoughts crowded on her distracted mind and she was ready to sink under her apprehensions she addressed herself to every saint in heaven and inwardly implored their assi,2
stance for a considerable time she remained in an agony of despair at last as softly as was possible she felt for the door and having found it entered trembling into the vault from whence she had heard the sigh and steps it gave her a kind of momentary joy to perceive an imperfect ray of clouded moonshine gleam from the roof of the vault which seemed to be fallen in and from whence hung a fragment of earth or building she could not distinguish which that appeared to have been crushed inwards she advanced eagerly towards this chasm when she discerned a human form standing close against the wall she shrieked believing it the ghost of her betrothed conrad the figure advancing said in a submissive voice be not alarmed lady i will not injure you isabella a little encouraged by the words and tone of voice of the stranger and recollecting that this must be the person who had opened the door recovered her spirits enough to reply sir whoever you are take pity on a wretched princess,2
standing on the brink of destruction assist me to escape from this fatal castle or in a few moments i may be made miserable for ever alas said the stranger what can i do to assist you i will die in your defence but i am unacquainted with the castle and want oh said isabella hastily interrupting him help me but to find a trapdoor that must be hereabout and it is the greatest service you can do me for i have not a minute to lose saying these words she felt about on the pavement and directed the stranger to search likewise for a smooth piece of brass enclosed in one of the stones that said she is the lock which opens with a spring of which i know the secret if we can find that i may escapeif not alas courteous stranger i fear i shall have involved you in my misfortunes manfred will suspect you for the accomplice of my flight and you will fall a victim to his resentment i value not my life said the stranger and it will be some comfort to lose it in trying,2
to deliver you from his tyranny generous youth said isabella how shall i ever requite as she uttered those words a ray of moonshine streaming through a cranny of the ruin above shone directly on the lock they sought oh transport said isabella here is the trapdoor and taking out the key she touched the spring which starting aside discovered an iron ring lift up the door said the princess the stranger obeyed and beneath appeared some stone steps descending into a vault totally dark we must go down here said isabella follow me dark and dismal as it is we cannot miss our way it leads directly to the church of st nicholas but perhaps added the princess modestly you have no reason to leave the castle nor have i farther occasion for your service in a few minutes i shall be safe from manfreds rageonly let me know to whom i am so much obliged i will never quit you said the stranger eagerly until i have placed you in safetynor think me princess more g,2
enerous than i am though you are my principal care the stranger was interrupted by a sudden noise of voices that seemed approaching and they soon distinguished these words talk not to me of necromancers i tell you she must be in the castle i will find her in spite of enchantment oh heavens cried isabella it is the voice of manfred make haste or we are ruined and shut the trapdoor after you saying this she descended the steps precipitately and as the stranger hastened to follow her he let the door slip out of his hands it fell and the spring closed over it he tried in vain to open it not having observed isabellas method of touching the spring nor had he many moments to make an essay the noise of the falling door had been heard by manfred who directed by the sound hastened thither attended by his servants with torches it must be isabella cried manfred before he entered the vault she is escaping by the subterraneous passage but she cannot have got far what was,2
the astonishment of the prince when instead of isabella the light of the torches discovered to him the young peasant whom he thought confined under the fatal helmet traitor said manfred how camest thou here i thought thee in durance above in the court i am no traitor replied the young man boldly nor am i answerable for your thoughts presumptuous villain cried manfred dost thou provoke my wrath tell me how hast thou escaped from above thou hast corrupted thy guards and their lives shall answer it my poverty said the peasant calmly will disculpate them though the ministers of a tyrants wrath to thee they are faithful and but too willing to execute the orders which you unjustly imposed upon them art thou so hardy as to dare my vengeance said the prince but tortures shall force the truth from thee tell me i will know thy accomplices there was my accomplice said the youth smiling and pointing to the roof manfred ordered the torches to be held up and pe,2
rceived that one of the cheeks of the enchanted casque had forced its way through the pavement of the court as his servants had let it fall over the peasant and had broken through into the vault leaving a gap through which the peasant had pressed himself some minutes before he was found by isabella was that the way by which thou didst descend said manfred it was said the youth but what noise was that said manfred which i heard as i entered the cloister a door clapped said the peasant i heard it as well as you what door said manfred hastily i am not acquainted with your castle said the peasant this is the first time i ever entered it and this vault the only part of it within which i ever was but i tell thee said manfred wishing to find out if the youth had discovered the trapdoor it was this way i heard the noise my servants heard it too my lord interrupted one of them officiously to be sure it was the trapdoor and he was going to make his escape,2
peace blockhead said the prince angrily if he was going to escape how should he come on this side i will know from his own mouth what noise it was i heard tell me truly thy life depends on thy veracity my veracity is dearer to me than my life said the peasant nor would i purchase the one by forfeiting the other indeed young philosopher said manfred contemptuously tell me then what was the noise i heard ask me what i can answer said he and put me to death instantly if i tell you a lie manfred growing impatient at the steady valour and indifference of the youth cried well then thou man of truth answer was it the fall of the trapdoor that i heard it was said the youth it was said the prince and how didst thou come to know there was a trapdoor here i saw the plate of brass by a gleam of moonshine replied he but what told thee it was a lock said manfred how didst thou discover the secret of opening it providence that delivered me,2
from the helmet was able to direct me to the spring of a lock said he providence should have gone a little farther and have placed thee out of the reach of my resentment said manfred when providence had taught thee to open the lock it abandoned thee for a fool who did not know how to make use of its favours why didst thou not pursue the path pointed out for thy escape why didst thou shut the trapdoor before thou hadst descended the steps i might ask you my lord said the peasant how i totally unacquainted with your castle was to know that those steps led to any outlet but i scorn to evade your questions wherever those steps lead to perhaps i should have explored the wayi could not be in a worse situation than i was but the truth is i let the trapdoor fall your immediate arrival followed i had given the alarmwhat imported it to me whether i was seized a minute sooner or a minute later thou art a resolute villain for thy years said manfred yet on reflection i suspect,2
thou dost but trifle with me thou hast not yet told me how thou didst open the lock that i will show you my lord said the peasant and taking up a fragment of stone that had fallen from above he laid himself on the trapdoor and began to beat on the piece of brass that covered it meaning to gain time for the escape of the princess this presence of mind joined to the frankness of the youth staggered manfred he even felt a disposition towards pardoning one who had been guilty of no crime manfred was not one of those savage tyrants who wanton in cruelty unprovoked the circumstances of his fortune had given an asperity to his temper which was naturally humane and his virtues were always ready to operate when his passions did not obscure his reason while the prince was in this suspense a confused noise of voices echoed through the distant vaults as the sound approached he distinguished the clamours of some of his domestics whom he had dispersed through the castle in search of isabella,2
calling out where is my lord where is the prince here i am said manfred as they came nearer have you found the princess the first that arrived replied oh my lord i am glad we have found you found me said manfred have you found the princess we thought we had my lord said the fellow looking terrified but but what cried the prince has she escaped jaquez and i my lord yes i and diego interrupted the second who came up in still greater consternation speak one of you at a time said manfred i ask you where is the princess we do not know said they both together but we are frightened out of our wits so i think blockheads said manfred what is it has scared you thus oh my lord said jaquez diego has seen such a sight your highness would not believe our eyes what new absurdity is this cried manfred give me a direct answer or by heaven why my lord if it please your highness to hear me said the poor fellow die,2
go and i yes i and jaquez cried his comrade did not i forbid you to speak both at a time said the prince you jaquez answer for the other fool seems more distracted than thou art what is the matter my gracious lord said jaquez if it please your highness to hear me diego and i according to your highnesss orders went to search for the young lady but being comprehensive that we might meet the ghost of my young lord your highnesss son god rest his soul as he has not received christian burial sot cried manfred in a rage is it only a ghost then that thou hast seen oh worse worse my lord cried diego i had rather have seen ten whole ghosts grant me patience said manfred these blockheads distract me out of my sight diego and thou jaquez tell me in one word art thou sober art thou raving thou wast wont to have some sense has the other sot frightened himself and thee too speak what is it he fancies he has seen why my lord replied jaquez tr,2
embling i was going to tell your highness that since the calamitous misfortune of my young lord god rest his precious soul not one of us your highnesss faithful servantsindeed we are my lord though poor meni say not one of us has dared to set a foot about the castle but two together so diego and i thinking that my young lady might be in the great gallery went up there to look for her and tell her your highness wanted something to impart to her o blundering fools cried manfred and in the meantime she has made her escape because you were afraid of goblinswhy thou knave she left me in the gallery i came from thence myself for all that she may be there still for aught i know said jaquez but the devil shall have me before i seek her there againpoor diego i do not believe he will ever recover it recover what said manfred am i never to learn what it is has terrified these rascalsbut i lose my time follow me slave i will see if she is in the gallery for heave,2
ns sake my dear good lord cried jaquez do not go to the gallery satan himself i believe is in the chamber next to the gallery manfred who hitherto had treated the terror of his servants as an idle panic was struck at this new circumstance he recollected the apparition of the portrait and the sudden closing of the door at the end of the gallery his voice faltered and he asked with disorder what is in the great chamber my lord said jaquez when diego and i came into the gallery he went first for he said he had more courage than i so when we came into the gallery we found nobody we looked under every bench and stool and still we found nobody were all the pictures in their places said manfred yes my lord answered jaquez but we did not think of looking behind them well well said manfred proceed when we came to the door of the great chamber continued jaquez we found it shut and could not you open it said manfred oh yes my lord would to heave,2
n we had not replied henay it was not i neither it was diego he was grown foolhardy and would go on though i advised him notif ever i open a door that is shut again trifle not said manfred shuddering but tell me what you saw in the great chamber on opening the door i my lord said jaquez i was behind diego but i heard the noise jaquez said manfred in a solemn tone of voice tell me i adjure thee by the souls of my ancestors what was it thou sawest what was it thou heardest it was diego saw it my lord it was not i replied jaquez i only heard the noise diego had no sooner opened the door than he cried out and ran back i ran back too and said is it the ghost the ghost no no said diego and his hair stood on endit is a giant i believe he is all clad in armour for i saw his foot and part of his leg and they are as large as the helmet below in the court as he said these words my lord we heard a violent motion and the rattling of armour as if,2
the giant was rising for diego has told me since that he believes the giant was lying down for the foot and leg were stretched at length on the floor before we could get to the end of the gallery we heard the door of the great chamber clap behind us but we did not dare turn back to see if the giant was following usyet now i think on it we must have heard him if he had pursued usbut for heavens sake good my lord send for the chaplain and have the castle exorcised for for certain it is enchanted ay pray do my lord cried all the servants at once or we must leave your highnesss service peace dotards said manfred and follow me i will know what all this means we my lord cried they with one voice we would not go up to the gallery for your highnesss revenue the young peasant who had stood silent now spoke will your highness said he permit me to try this adventure my life is of consequence to nobody i fear no bad angel and have offended no good one your,2
behaviour is above your seeming said manfred viewing him with surprise and admirationhereafter i will reward your braverybut now continued he with a sigh i am so circumstanced that i dare trust no eyes but my own however i give you leave to accompany me manfred when he first followed isabella from the gallery had gone directly to the apartment of his wife concluding the princess had retired thither hippolita who knew his step rose with anxious fondness to meet her lord whom she had not seen since the death of their son she would have flown in a transport mixed of joy and grief to his bosom but he pushed her rudely off and said where is isabella isabella my lord said the astonished hippolita yes isabella cried manfred imperiously i want isabella my lord replied matilda who perceived how much his behaviour had shocked her mother she has not been with us since your highness summoned her to your apartment tell me where she is said the prince i do not wa,2
nt to know where she has been my good lord says hippolita your daughter tells you the truth isabella left us by your command and has not returned sincebut my good lord compose yourself retire to your rest this dismal day has disordered you isabella shall wait your orders in the morning what then you know where she is cried manfred tell me directly for i will not lose an instantand you woman speaking to his wife order your chaplain to attend me forthwith isabella said hippolita calmly is retired i suppose to her chamber she is not accustomed to watch at this late hour gracious my lord continued she let me know what has disturbed you has isabella offended you trouble me not with questions said manfred but tell me where she is matilda shall call her said the princess sit down my lord and resume your wonted fortitude what art thou jealous of isabella replied he that you wish to be present at our interview good heavens my lord sai,2
d hippolita what is it your highness means thou wilt know ere many minutes are passed said the cruel prince send your chaplain to me and wait my pleasure here at these words he flung out of the room in search of isabella leaving the amazed ladies thunderstruck with his words and frantic deportment and lost in vain conjectures on what he was meditating manfred was now returning from the vault attended by the peasant and a few of his servants whom he had obliged to accompany him he ascended the staircase without stopping till he arrived at the gallery at the door of which he met hippolita and her chaplain when diego had been dismissed by manfred he had gone directly to the princesss apartment with the alarm of what he had seen that excellent lady who no more than manfred doubted of the reality of the vision yet affected to treat it as a delirium of the servant willing however to save her lord from any additional shock and prepared by a series of griefs not to tremble at any access,2
ion to it she determined to make herself the first sacrifice if fate had marked the present hour for their destruction dismissing the reluctant matilda to her rest who in vain sued for leave to accompany her mother and attended only by her chaplain hippolita had visited the gallery and great chamber and now with more serenity of soul than she had felt for many hours she met her lord and assured him that the vision of the gigantic leg and foot was all a fable and no doubt an impression made by fear and the dark and dismal hour of the night on the minds of his servants she and the chaplain had examined the chamber and found everything in the usual order manfred though persuaded like his wife that the vision had been no work of fancy recovered a little from the tempest of mind into which so many strange events had thrown him ashamed too of his inhuman treatment of a princess who returned every injury with new marks of tenderness and duty he felt returning love forcing itself into his eyes,2
but not less ashamed of feeling remorse towards one against whom he was inwardly meditating a yet more bitter outrage he curbed the yearnings of his heart and did not dare to lean even towards pity the next transition of his soul was to exquisite villainy presuming on the unshaken submission of hippolita he flattered himself that she would not only acquiesce with patience to a divorce but would obey if it was his pleasure in endeavouring to persuade isabella to give him her handbut ere he could indulge his horrid hope he reflected that isabella was not to be found coming to himself he gave orders that every avenue to the castle should be strictly guarded and charged his domestics on pain of their lives to suffer nobody to pass out the young peasant to whom he spoke favourably he ordered to remain in a small chamber on the stairs in which there was a palletbed and the key of which he took away himself telling the youth he would talk with him in the morning then dismissing his attendants,2
and bestowing a sullen kind of halfnod on hippolita he retired to his own chamber chapter ii matilda who by hippolitas order had retired to her apartment was illdisposed to take any rest the shocking fate of her brother had deeply affected her she was surprised at not seeing isabella but the strange words which had fallen from her father and his obscure menace to the princess his wife accompanied by the most furious behaviour had filled her gentle mind with terror and alarm she waited anxiously for the return of bianca a young damsel that attended her whom she had sent to learn what was become of isabella bianca soon appeared and informed her mistress of what she had gathered from the servants that isabella was nowhere to be found she related the adventure of the young peasant who had been discovered in the vault though with many simple additions from the incoherent accounts of the domestics and she dwelt principally on the gigantic leg and foot which had been seen in the galler,2
ychamber this last circumstance had terrified bianca so much that she was rejoiced when matilda told her that she would not go to rest but would watch till the princess should rise the young princess wearied herself in conjectures on the flight of isabella and on the threats of manfred to her mother but what business could he have so urgent with the chaplain said matilda does he intend to have my brothers body interred privately in the chapel oh madam said bianca now i guess as you are become his heiress he is impatient to have you married he has always been raving for more sons i warrant he is now impatient for grandsons as sure as i live madam i shall see you a bride at lastgood madam you wont cast off your faithful bianca you wont put donna rosara over me now you are a great princess my poor bianca said matilda how fast your thoughts amble i a great princess what hast thou seen in manfreds behaviour since my brothers death that bespeaks any increase of tender,2
ness to me no bianca his heart was ever a stranger to mebut he is my father and i must not complain nay if heaven shuts my fathers heart against me it overpays my little merit in the tenderness of my mothero that dear mother yes bianca tis there i feel the rugged temper of manfred i can support his harshness to me with patience but it wounds my soul when i am witness to his causeless severity towards her oh madam said bianca all men use their wives so when they are weary of them and yet you congratulated me but now said matilda when you fancied my father intended to dispose of me i would have you a great lady replied bianca come what will i do not wish to see you moped in a convent as you would be if you had your will and if my lady your mother who knows that a bad husband is better than no husband at all did not hinder youbless me what noise is that st nicholas forgive me i was but in jest it is the wind said matilda whistling through the battleme,2
nts in the tower above you have heard it a thousand times nay said bianca there was no harm neither in what i said it is no sin to talk of matrimonyand so madam as i was saying if my lord manfred should offer you a handsome young prince for a bridegroom you would drop him a curtsey and tell him you would rather take the veil thank heaven i am in no such danger said matilda you know how many proposals for me he has rejected and you thank him like a dutiful daughter do you madam but come madam suppose tomorrow morning he was to send for you to the great council chamber and there you should find at his elbow a lovely young prince with large black eyes a smooth white forehead and manly curling locks like jet in short madam a young hero resembling the picture of the good alfonso in the gallery which you sit and gaze at for hours together do not speak lightly of that picture interrupted matilda sighing i know the adoration with which i look at that picture is un,2
commonbut i am not in love with a coloured panel the character of that virtuous prince the veneration with which my mother has inspired me for his memory the orisons which i know not why she has enjoined me to pour forth at his tomb all have concurred to persuade me that somehow or other my destiny is linked with something relating to him lord madam how should that be said bianca i have always heard that your family was in no way related to his and i am sure i cannot conceive why my lady the princess sends you in a cold morning or a damp evening to pray at his tomb he is no saint by the almanack if you must pray why does she not bid you address yourself to our great st nicholas i am sure he is the saint i pray to for a husband perhaps my mind would be less affected said matilda if my mother would explain her reasons to me but it is the mystery she observes that inspires me with thisi know not what to call it as she never acts from caprice i am sure there is some fatal sec,2
ret at bottomnay i know there is in her agony of grief for my brothers death she dropped some words that intimated as much oh dear madam cried bianca what were they no said matilda if a parent lets fall a word and wishes it recalled it is not for a child to utter it what was she sorry for what she had said asked bianca i am sure madam you may trust me with my own little secrets when i have any i may said matilda but never with my mothers a child ought to have no ears or eyes but as a parent directs well to be sure madam you were born to be a saint said bianca and there is no resisting ones vocation you will end in a convent at last but there is my lady isabella would not be so reserved to me she will let me talk to her of young men and when a handsome cavalier has come to the castle she has owned to me that she wished your brother conrad resembled him bianca said the princess i do not allow you to mention my friend disrespectfully isabella,2
is of a cheerful disposition but her soul is pure as virtue itself she knows your idle babbling humour and perhaps has now and then encouraged it to divert melancholy and enliven the solitude in which my father keeps us blessed mary said bianca starting there it is again dear madam do you hear nothing this castle is certainly haunted peace said matilda and listen i did think i heard a voicebut it must be fancy your terrors i suppose have infected me indeed indeed madam said bianca halfweeping with agony i am sure i heard a voice does anybody lie in the chamber beneath said the princess nobody has dared to lie there answered bianca since the great astrologer that was your brothers tutor drowned himself for certain madam his ghost and the young princes are now met in the chamber belowfor heavens sake let us fly to your mothers apartment i charge you not to stir said matilda if they are spirits in pain we may ease their sufferings by ques,2
tioning them they can mean no hurt to us for we have not injured themand if they should shall we be more safe in one chamber than in another reach me my beads we will say a prayer and then speak to them oh dear lady i would not speak to a ghost for the world cried bianca as she said those words they heard the casement of the little chamber below matildas open they listened attentively and in a few minutes thought they heard a person sing but could not distinguish the words this can be no evil spirit said the princess in a low voice it is undoubtedly one of the familyopen the window and we shall know the voice i dare not indeed madam said bianca thou art a very fool said matilda opening the window gently herself the noise the princess made was however heard by the person beneath who stopped and they concluded had heard the casement open is anybody below said the princess if there is speak yes said an unknown voice who is it said matilda a s,2
tranger replied the voice what stranger said she and how didst thou come there at this unusual hour when all the gates of the castle are locked i am not here willingly answered the voice but pardon me lady if i have disturbed your rest i knew not that i was overheard sleep had forsaken me i left a restless couch and came to waste the irksome hours with gazing on the fair approach of morning impatient to be dismissed from this castle thy words and accents said matilda are of melancholy cast if thou art unhappy i pity thee if poverty afflicts thee let me know it i will mention thee to the princess whose beneficent soul ever melts for the distressed and she will relieve thee i am indeed unhappy said the stranger and i know not what wealth is but i do not complain of the lot which heaven has cast for me i am young and healthy and am not ashamed of owing my support to myselfyet think me not proud or that i disdain your generous offers i will remember you in my,2
orisons and will pray for blessings on your gracious self and your noble mistressif i sigh lady it is for others not for myself now i have it madam said bianca whispering the princess this is certainly the young peasant and by my conscience he is in lovewell this is a charming adventuredo madam let us sift him he does not know you but takes you for one of my lady hippolitas women art thou not ashamed bianca said the princess what right have we to pry into the secrets of this young mans heart he seems virtuous and frank and tells us he is unhappy are those circumstances that authorise us to make a property of him how are we entitled to his confidence lord madam how little you know of love replied bianca why lovers have no pleasure equal to talking of their mistress and would you have me become a peasants confidante said the princess well then let me talk to him said bianca though i have the honour of being your highnesss maid of honour i w,2
as not always so great besides if love levels ranks it raises them too i have a respect for any young man in love peace simpleton said the princess though he said he was unhappy it does not follow that he must be in love think of all that has happened today and tell me if there are no misfortunes but what love causesstranger resumed the princess if thy misfortunes have not been occasioned by thy own fault and are within the compass of the princess hippolitas power to redress i will take upon me to answer that she will be thy protectress when thou art dismissed from this castle repair to holy father jerome at the convent adjoining to the church of st nicholas and make thy story known to him as far as thou thinkest meet he will not fail to inform the princess who is the mother of all that want her assistance farewell it is not seemly for me to hold farther converse with a man at this unwonted hour may the saints guard thee gracious lady replied the peasant but oh if,2
a poor and worthless stranger might presume to beg a minutes audience farther am i so happy the casement is not shut might i venture to ask speak quickly said matilda the morning dawns apace should the labourers come into the fields and perceive uswhat wouldst thou ask i know not how i know not if i dare said the young stranger faltering yet the humanity with which you have spoken to me emboldenslady dare i trust you heavens said matilda what dost thou mean with what wouldst thou trust me speak boldly if thy secret is fit to be entrusted to a virtuous breast i would ask said the peasant recollecting himself whether what i have heard from the domestics is true that the princess is missing from the castle what imports it to thee to know replied matilda thy first words bespoke a prudent and becoming gravity dost thou come hither to pry into the secrets of manfred adieu i have been mistaken in thee saying these words she shut the casement hastily witho,2
ut giving the young man time to reply i had acted more wisely said the princess to bianca with some sharpness if i had let thee converse with this peasant his inquisitiveness seems of a piece with thy own it is not fit for me to argue with your highness replied bianca but perhaps the questions i should have put to him would have been more to the purpose than those you have been pleased to ask him oh no doubt said matilda you are a very discreet personage may i know what you would have asked him a bystander often sees more of the game than those that play answered bianca does your highness think madam that this question about my lady isabella was the result of mere curiosity no no madam there is more in it than you great folks are aware of lopez told me that all the servants believe this young fellow contrived my lady isabellas escape now pray madam observe you and i both know that my lady isabella never much fancied the prince your brother well he is killed j,2
ust in a critical minutei accuse nobody a helmet falls from the moonso my lord your father says but lopez and all the servants say that this young spark is a magician and stole it from alfonsos tomb have done with this rhapsody of impertinence said matilda nay madam as you please cried bianca yet it is very particular though that my lady isabella should be missing the very same day and that this young sorcerer should be found at the mouth of the trapdoor i accuse nobody but if my young lord came honestly by his death dare not on thy duty said matilda to breathe a suspicion on the purity of my dear isabellas fame purity or not purity said bianca gone she isa stranger is found that nobody knows you question him yourself he tells you he is in love or unhappy it is the same thingnay he owned he was unhappy about others and is anybody unhappy about another unless they are in love with them and at the very next word he asks innocently pour soul if my lady i,2
sabella is missing to be sure said matilda thy observations are not totally without foundationisabellas flight amazes me the curiosity of the stranger is very particular yet isabella never concealed a thought from me so she told you said bianca to fish out your secrets but who knows madam but this stranger may be some prince in disguise do madam let me open the window and ask him a few questions no replied matilda i will ask him myself if he knows aught of isabella he is not worthy i should converse farther with him she was going to open the casement when they heard the bell ring at the posterngate of the castle which is on the right hand of the tower where matilda lay this prevented the princess from renewing the conversation with the stranger after continuing silent for some time i am persuaded said she to bianca that whatever be the cause of isabellas flight it had no unworthy motive if this stranger was accessory to it she must be satisfied with his f,2
idelity and worth i observed did not you bianca that his words were tinctured with an uncommon infusion of piety it was no ruffians speech his phrases were becoming a man of gentle birth i told you madam said bianca that i was sure he was some prince in disguise yet said matilda if he was privy to her escape how will you account for his not accompanying her in her flight why expose himself unnecessarily and rashly to my fathers resentment as for that madam replied she if he could get from under the helmet he will find ways of eluding your fathers anger i do not doubt but he has some talisman or other about him you resolve everything into magic said matilda but a man who has any intercourse with infernal spirits does not dare to make use of those tremendous and holy words which he uttered didst thou not observe with what fervour he vowed to remember me to heaven in his prayers yes isabella was undoubtedly convinced of his piety commend me to the piety of,2
a young fellow and a damsel that consult to elope said bianca no no madam my lady isabella is of another guess mould than you take her for she used indeed to sigh and lift up her eyes in your company because she knows you are a saint but when your back was turned you wrong her said matilda isabella is no hypocrite she has a due sense of devotion but never affected a call she has not on the contrary she always combated my inclination for the cloister and though i own the mystery she has made to me of her flight confounds me though it seems inconsistent with the friendship between us i cannot forget the disinterested warmth with which she always opposed my taking the veil she wished to see me married though my dower would have been a loss to her and my brothers children for her sake i will believe well of this young peasant then you do think there is some liking between them said bianca while she was speaking a servant came hastily into the chamber and told the princess tha,2

addresses to second his views till the censures of the church could be fulminated against a divorce with this intention as if struck with the princes scruples he at length said my lord i have been pondering on what your highness has said and if in truth it is delicacy of conscience that is the real motive of your repugnance to your virtuous lady far be it from me to endeavour to harden your heart the church is an indulgent mother unfold your griefs to her she alone can administer comfort to your soul either by satisfying your conscience or upon examination of your scruples by setting you at liberty and indulging you in the lawful means of continuing your lineage in the latter case if the lady isabella can be brought to consent manfred who concluded that he had either overreached the good man or that his first warmth had been but a tribute paid to appearance was overjoyed at this sudden turn and repeated the most magnificent promises if he should succeed by the friars mediation,2
the wellmeaning priest suffered him to deceive himself fully determined to traverse his views instead of seconding them since we now understand one another resumed the prince i expect father that you satisfy me in one point who is the youth that i found in the vault he must have been privy to isabellas flight tell me truly is he her lover or is he an agent for anothers passion i have often suspected isabellas indifference to my son a thousand circumstances crowd on my mind that confirm that suspicion she herself was so conscious of it that while i discoursed her in the gallery she outran my suspicions and endeavoured to justify herself from coolness to conrad the friar who knew nothing of the youth but what he had learnt occasionally from the princess ignorant what was become of him and not sufficiently reflecting on the impetuosity of manfreds temper conceived that it might not be amiss to sow the seeds of jealousy in his mind they might be turned to some use hereafter ei,2

cried manfred in a rage a peasant within sight of death is not animated by such sentiments tell me tell me rash boy who thou art or the rack shall force thy secret from thee thou hast threatened me with death already said the youth for the truth i have told thee if that is all the encouragement i am to expect for sincerity i am not tempted to indulge thy vain curiosity farther then thou wilt not speak said manfred i will not replied he bear him away into the courtyard said manfred i will see his head this instant severed from his body matilda fainted at hearing those words bianca shrieked and criedhelp help the princess is dead manfred started at this ejaculation and demanded what was the matter the young peasant who heard it too was struck with horror and asked eagerly the same question but manfred ordered him to be hurried into the court and kept there for execution till he had informed himself of the cause of biancas shrieks when he learned the mean,2
ing he treated it as a womanish panic and ordering matilda to be carried to her apartment he rushed into the court and calling for one of his guards bade theodore kneel down and prepare to receive the fatal blow the undaunted youth received the bitter sentence with a resignation that touched every heart but manfreds he wished earnestly to know the meaning of the words he had heard relating to the princess but fearing to exasperate the tyrant more against her he desisted the only boon he deigned to ask was that he might be permitted to have a confessor and make his peace with heaven manfred who hoped by the confessors means to come at the youths history readily granted his request and being convinced that father jerome was now in his interest he ordered him to be called and shrive the prisoner the holy man who had little foreseen the catastrophe that his imprudence occasioned fell on his knees to the prince and adjured him in the most solemn manner not to shed innocent blood he accus,2

castle was suddenly sounded at the same instant the sable plumes on the enchanted helmet which still remained at the other end of the court were tempestuously agitated and nodded thrice as if bowed by some invisible wearer chapter iii manfreds heart misgave him when he beheld the plumage on the miraculous casque shaken in concert with the sounding of the brazen trumpet father said he to jerome whom he now ceased to treat as count of falconara what mean these portents if i have offended the plumes were shaken with greater violence than before unhappy prince that i am cried manfred holy father will you not assist me with your prayers my lord replied jerome heaven is no doubt displeased with your mockery of its servants submit yourself to the church and cease to persecute her ministers dismiss this innocent youth and learn to respect the holy character i wear heaven will not be trifled with you see the trumpet sounded again i acknowledge i have been too hasty,2

e father and son to exchange a hasty embrace at parting he then withdrew to the hall and seating himself in princely state ordered the herald to be admitted to his presence well thou insolent said the prince what wouldst thou with me i come replied he to thee manfred usurper of the principality of otranto from the renowned and invincible knight the knight of the gigantic sabre in the name of his lord frederic marquis of vicenza he demands the lady isabella daughter of that prince whom thou hast basely and traitorously got into thy power by bribing her false guardians during his absence and he requires thee to resign the principality of otranto which thou hast usurped from the said lord frederic the nearest of blood to the last rightful lord alfonso the good if thou dost not instantly comply with these just demands he defies thee to single combat to the last extremity and so saying the herald cast down his warder and where is this braggart who sends thee said manfred,2
at the distance of a league said the herald he comes to make good his lords claim against thee as he is a true knight and thou an usurper and ravisher injurious as this challenge was manfred reflected that it was not his interest to provoke the marquis he knew how well founded the claim of frederic was nor was this the first time he had heard of it frederics ancestors had assumed the style of princes of otranto from the death of alfonso the good without issue but manfred his father and grandfather had been too powerful for the house of vicenza to dispossess them frederic a martial and amorous young prince had married a beautiful young lady of whom he was enamoured and who had died in childbed of isabella her death affected him so much that he had taken the cross and gone to the holy land where he was wounded in an engagement against the infidels made prisoner and reported to be dead when the news reached manfreds ears he bribed the guardians of the lady isabella to deliver h,2
er up to him as a bride for his son conrad by which alliance he had proposed to unite the claims of the two houses this motive on conrads death had cooperated to make him so suddenly resolve on espousing her himself and the same reflection determined him now to endeavour at obtaining the consent of frederic to this marriage a like policy inspired him with the thought of inviting frederics champion into the castle lest he should be informed of isabellas flight which he strictly enjoined his domestics not to disclose to any of the knights retinue herald said manfred as soon as he had digested these reflections return to thy master and tell him ere we liquidate our differences by the sword manfred would hold some converse with him bid him welcome to my castle where by my faith as i am a true knight he shall have courteous reception and full security for himself and followers if we cannot adjust our quarrel by amicable means i swear he shall depart in safety and shall have full sat,2
isfaction according to the laws of arms so help me god and his holy trinity the herald made three obeisances and retired during this interview jeromes mind was agitated by a thousand contrary passions he trembled for the life of his son and his first thought was to persuade isabella to return to the castle yet he was scarce less alarmed at the thought of her union with manfred he dreaded hippolitas unbounded submission to the will of her lord and though he did not doubt but he could alarm her piety not to consent to a divorce if he could get access to her yet should manfred discover that the obstruction came from him it might be equally fatal to theodore he was impatient to know whence came the herald who with so little management had questioned the title of manfred yet he did not dare absent himself from the convent lest isabella should leave it and her flight be imputed to him he returned disconsolately to the monastery uncertain on what conduct to resolve a monk who met him in the,2
porch and observed his melancholy air said alas brother is it then true that we have lost our excellent princess hippolita the holy man started and cried what meanest thou brother i come this instant from the castle and left her in perfect health martelli replied the other friar passed by the convent but a quarter of an hour ago on his way from the castle and reported that her highness was dead all our brethren are gone to the chapel to pray for her happy transit to a better life and willed me to wait thy arrival they know thy holy attachment to that good lady and are anxious for the affliction it will cause in theeindeed we have all reason to weep she was a mother to our house but this life is but a pilgrimage we must not murmurwe shall all follow her may our end be like hers good brother thou dreamest said jerome i tell thee i come from the castle and left the princess well where is the lady isabella poor gentlewoman replied the friar i told her the sad n,2
ews and offered her spiritual comfort i reminded her of the transitory condition of mortality and advised her to take the veil i quoted the example of the holy princess sanchia of arragon thy zeal was laudable said jerome impatiently but at present it was unnecessary hippolita is wellat least i trust in the lord she is i heard nothing to the contraryyet methinks the princes earnestnesswell brother but where is the lady isabella i know not said the friar she wept much and said she would retire to her chamber jerome left his comrade abruptly and hastened to the princess but she was not in her chamber he inquired of the domestics of the convent but could learn no news of her he searched in vain throughout the monastery and the church and despatched messengers round the neighbourhood to get intelligence if she had been seen but to no purpose nothing could equal the good mans perplexity he judged that isabella suspecting manfred of having precipitated his wifes death,2
had taken the alarm and withdrawn herself to some more secret place of concealment this new flight would probably carry the princes fury to the height the report of hippolitas death though it seemed almost incredible increased his consternation and though isabellas escape bespoke her aversion of manfred for a husband jerome could feel no comfort from it while it endangered the life of his son he determined to return to the castle and made several of his brethren accompany him to attest his innocence to manfred and if necessary join their intercession with his for theodore the prince in the meantime had passed into the court and ordered the gates of the castle to be flung open for the reception of the stranger knight and his train in a few minutes the cavalcade arrived first came two harbingers with wands next a herald followed by two pages and two trumpets then a hundred footguards these were attended by as many horse after them fifty footmen clothed in scarlet and black the c,2

the words of the challenge manfreds eyes were fixed on the gigantic sword and he scarce seemed to attend to the cartel but his attention was soon diverted by a tempest of wind that rose behind him he turned and beheld the plumes of the enchanted helmet agitated in the same extraordinary manner as before it required intrepidity like manfreds not to sink under a concurrence of circumstances that seemed to announce his fate yet scorning in the presence of strangers to betray the courage he had always manifested he said boldly sir knight whoever thou art i bid thee welcome if thou art of mortal mould thy valour shall meet its equal and if thou art a true knight thou wilt scorn to employ sorcery to carry thy point be these omens from heaven or hell manfred trusts to the righteousness of his cause and to the aid of st nicholas who has ever protected his house alight sir knight and repose thyself tomorrow thou shalt have a fair field and heaven befriend the juster side the knight made,2
no reply but dismounting was conducted by manfred to the great hall of the castle as they traversed the court the knight stopped to gaze on the miraculous casque and kneeling down seemed to pray inwardly for some minutes rising he made a sign to the prince to lead on as soon as they entered the hall manfred proposed to the stranger to disarm but the knight shook his head in token of refusal sir knight said manfred this is not courteous but by my good faith i will not cross thee nor shalt thou have cause to complain of the prince of otranto no treachery is designed on my part i hope none is intended on thine here take my gage giving him his ring your friends and you shall enjoy the laws of hospitality rest here until refreshments are brought i will but give orders for the accommodation of your train and return to you the three knights bowed as accepting his courtesy manfred directed the strangers retinue to be conducted to an adjacent hospital founded by the princess hippoli,2

ome of isabella yet equally afraid of their knowing impatient to pursue her yet dreading to have them join in the pursuit he offered to despatch messengers in quest of her but the chief knight no longer keeping silence reproached manfred in bitter terms for his dark and ambiguous dealing and demanded the cause of isabellas first absence from the castle manfred casting a stern look at jerome implying a command of silence pretended that on conrads death he had placed her in sanctuary until he could determine how to dispose of her jerome who trembled for his sons life did not dare contradict this falsehood but one of his brethren not under the same anxiety declared frankly that she had fled to their church in the preceding night the prince in vain endeavoured to stop this discovery which overwhelmed him with shame and confusion the principal stranger amazed at the contradictions he heard and more than half persuaded that manfred had secreted the princess notwithstanding the concern he,2
expressed at her flight rushing to the door said thou traitor prince isabella shall be found manfred endeavoured to hold him but the other knights assisting their comrade he broke from the prince and hastened into the court demanding his attendants manfred finding it vain to divert him from the pursuit offered to accompany him and summoning his attendants and taking jerome and some of the friars to guide them they issued from the castle manfred privately giving orders to have the knights company secured while to the knight he affected to despatch a messenger to require their assistance the company had no sooner quitted the castle than matilda who felt herself deeply interested for the young peasant since she had seen him condemned to death in the hall and whose thoughts had been taken up with concerting measures to save him was informed by some of the female attendants that manfred had despatched all his men various ways in pursuit of isabella he had in his hurry given this order i,2

yonder behind that forest to the east is a chain of rocks hollowed into a labyrinth of caverns that reach to the sea coast there thou mayst lie concealed till thou canst make signs to some vessel to put on shore and take thee off go heaven be thy guideand sometimes in thy prayers remembermatilda theodore flung himself at her feet and seizing her lily hand which with struggles she suffered him to kiss he vowed on the earliest opportunity to get himself knighted and fervently entreated her permission to swear himself eternally her knight ere the princess could reply a clap of thunder was suddenly heard that shook the battlements theodore regardless of the tempest would have urged his suit but the princess dismayed retreated hastily into the castle and commanded the youth to be gone with an air that would not be disobeyed he sighed and retired but with eyes fixed on the gate until matilda closing it put an end to an interview in which the hearts of both had drunk so deeply of a,2
passion which both now tasted for the first time theodore went pensively to the convent to acquaint his father with his deliverance there he learned the absence of jerome and the pursuit that was making after the lady isabella with some particulars of whose story he now first became acquainted the generous gallantry of his nature prompted him to wish to assist her but the monks could lend him no lights to guess at the route she had taken he was not tempted to wander far in search of her for the idea of matilda had imprinted itself so strongly on his heart that he could not bear to absent himself at much distance from her abode the tenderness jerome had expressed for him concurred to confirm this reluctance and he even persuaded himself that filial affection was the chief cause of his hovering between the castle and monastery until jerome should return at night theodore at length determined to repair to the forest that matilda had pointed out to him arriving there he sought the gloomiest sha,2
des as best suited to the pleasing melancholy that reigned in his mind in this mood he roved insensibly to the caves which had formerly served as a retreat to hermits and were now reported round the country to be haunted by evil spirits he recollected to have heard this tradition and being of a brave and adventurous disposition he willingly indulged his curiosity in exploring the secret recesses of this labyrinth he had not penetrated far before he thought he heard the steps of some person who seemed to retreat before him theodore though firmly grounded in all our holy faith enjoins to be believed had no apprehension that good men were abandoned without cause to the malice of the powers of darkness he thought the place more likely to be infested by robbers than by those infernal agents who are reported to molest and bewilder travellers he had long burned with impatience to approve his valour drawing his sabre he marched sedately onwards still directing his steps as the imperfect rustling sound,2
before him led the way the armour he wore was a like indication to the person who avoided him theodore now convinced that he was not mistaken redoubled his pace and evidently gained on the person that fled whose haste increasing theodore came up just as a woman fell breathless before him he hasted to raise her but her terror was so great that he apprehended she would faint in his arms he used every gentle word to dispel her alarms and assured her that far from injuring he would defend her at the peril of his life the lady recovering her spirits from his courteous demeanour and gazing on her protector said sure i have heard that voice before not to my knowledge replied theodore unless as i conjecture thou art the lady isabella merciful heaven cried she thou art not sent in quest of me art thou and saying those words she threw herself at his feet and besought him not to deliver her up to manfred to manfred cried theodoreno lady i have once already delivered th,2
ee from his tyranny and it shall fare hard with me now but i will place thee out of the reach of his daring is it possible said she that thou shouldst be the generous unknown whom i met last night in the vault of the castle sure thou art not a mortal but my guardian angel on my knees let me thank hold gentle princess said theodore nor demean thyself before a poor and friendless young man if heaven has selected me for thy deliverer it will accomplish its work and strengthen my arm in thy cause but come lady we are too near the mouth of the cavern let us seek its inmost recesses i can have no tranquillity till i have placed thee beyond the reach of danger alas what mean you sir said she though all your actions are noble though your sentiments speak the purity of your soul is it fitting that i should accompany you alone into these perplexed retreats should we be found together what would a censorious world think of my conduct i respect your virtuous delicacy sai,2
d theodore nor do you harbour a suspicion that wounds my honour i meant to conduct you into the most private cavity of these rocks and then at the hazard of my life to guard their entrance against every living thing besides lady continued he drawing a deep sigh beauteous and all perfect as your form is and though my wishes are not guiltless of aspiring know my soul is dedicated to another and although a sudden noise prevented theodore from proceeding they soon distinguished these sounds isabella what ho isabella the trembling princess relapsed into her former agony of fear theodore endeavoured to encourage her but in vain he assured her he would die rather than suffer her to return under manfreds power and begging her to remain concealed he went forth to prevent the person in search of her from approaching at the mouth of the cavern he found an armed knight discoursing with a peasant who assured him he had seen a lady enter the passes of the rock the knight was preparing t,2
o seek her when theodore placing himself in his way with his sword drawn sternly forbad him at his peril to advance and who art thou who darest to cross my way said the knight haughtily one who does not dare more than he will perform said theodore i seek the lady isabella said the knight and understand she has taken refuge among these rocks impede me not or thou wilt repent having provoked my resentment thy purpose is as odious as thy resentment is contemptible said theodore return whence thou camest or we shall soon know whose resentment is most terrible the stranger who was the principal knight that had arrived from the marquis of vicenza had galloped from manfred as he was busied in getting information of the princess and giving various orders to prevent her falling into the power of the three knights their chief had suspected manfred of being privy to the princesss absconding and this insult from a man who he concluded was stationed by that prince to secrete her,2
confirming his suspicions he made no reply but discharging a blow with his sabre at theodore would soon have removed all obstruction if theodore who took him for one of manfreds captains and who had no sooner given the provocation than prepared to support it had not received the stroke on his shield the valour that had so long been smothered in his breast broke forth at once he rushed impetuously on the knight whose pride and wrath were not less powerful incentives to hardy deeds the combat was furious but not long theodore wounded the knight in three several places and at last disarmed him as he fainted by the loss of blood the peasant who had fled on the first onset had given the alarm to some of manfreds domestics who by his orders were dispersed through the forest in pursuit of isabella they came up as the knight fell whom they soon discovered to be the noble stranger theodore notwithstanding his hatred to manfred could not behold the victory he had gained without emotions of,2
pity and generosity but he was more touched when he learned the quality of his adversary and was informed that he was no retainer but an enemy of manfred he assisted the servants of the latter in disarming the knight and in endeavouring to stanch the blood that flowed from his wounds the knight recovering his speech said in a faint and faltering voice generous foe we have both been in an error i took thee for an instrument of the tyrant i perceive thou hast made the like mistake it is too late for excuses i faint if isabella is at handcall heri have important secrets to he is dying said one of the attendants has nobody a crucifix about them andrea do thou pray over him fetch some water said theodore and pour it down his throat while i hasten to the princess saying this he flew to isabella and in few words told her modestly that he had been so unfortunate by mistake as to wound a gentleman from her fathers court who wished ere he died to impart something of cons,2
equence to her the princess who had been transported at hearing the voice of theodore as he called to her to come forth was astonished at what she heard suffering herself to be conducted by theodore the new proof of whose valour recalled her dispersed spirits she came where the bleeding knight lay speechless on the ground but her fears returned when she beheld the domestics of manfred she would again have fled if theodore had not made her observe that they were unarmed and had not threatened them with instant death if they should dare to seize the princess the stranger opening his eyes and beholding a woman said art thoupray tell me trulyart thou isabella of vicenza i am said she good heaven restore thee then thouthen thousaid the knight struggling for utteranceseestthy father give me one oh amazement horror what do i hear what do i see cried isabella my father you my father how came you here sir for heavens sake speak oh run for help or he will exp,2
ire tis most true said the wounded knight exerting all his force i am frederic thy father yes i came to deliver thee it will not be give me a parting kiss and take sir said theodore do not exhaust yourself suffer us to convey you to the castle to the castle said isabella is there no help nearer than the castle would you expose my father to the tyrant if he goes thither i dare not accompany him and yet can i leave him my child said frederic it matters not for me whither i am carried a few minutes will place me beyond danger but while i have eyes to dote on thee forsake me not dear isabella this brave knighti know not who he iswill protect thy innocence sir you will not abandon my child will you theodore shedding tears over his victim and vowing to guard the princess at the expense of his life persuaded frederic to suffer himself to be conducted to the castle they placed him on a horse belonging to one of the domestics after binding up his wounds as,2
well as they were able theodore marched by his side and the afflicted isabella who could not bear to quit him followed mournfully behind chapter iv the sorrowful troop no sooner arrived at the castle than they were met by hippolita and matilda whom isabella had sent one of the domestics before to advertise of their approach the ladies causing frederic to be conveyed into the nearest chamber retired while the surgeons examined his wounds matilda blushed at seeing theodore and isabella together but endeavoured to conceal it by embracing the latter and condoling with her on her fathers mischance the surgeons soon came to acquaint hippolita that none of the marquiss wounds were dangerous and that he was desirous of seeing his daughter and the princesses theodore under pretence of expressing his joy at being freed from his apprehensions of the combat being fatal to frederic could not resist the impulse of following matilda her eyes were so often cast down on meeting his that isabella,2
who regarded theodore as attentively as he gazed on matilda soon divined who the object was that he had told her in the cave engaged his affections while this mute scene passed hippolita demanded of frederic the cause of his having taken that mysterious course for reclaiming his daughter and threw in various apologies to excuse her lord for the match contracted between their children frederic however incensed against manfred was not insensible to the courtesy and benevolence of hippolita but he was still more struck with the lovely form of matilda wishing to detain them by his bedside he informed hippolita of his story he told her that while prisoner to the infidels he had dreamed that his daughter of whom he had learned no news since his captivity was detained in a castle where she was in danger of the most dreadful misfortunes and that if he obtained his liberty and repaired to a wood near joppa he would learn more alarmed at this dream and incapable of obeying the direction given by,2
it his chains became more grievous than ever but while his thoughts were occupied on the means of obtaining his liberty he received the agreeable news that the confederate princes who were warring in palestine had paid his ransom he instantly set out for the wood that had been marked in his dream for three days he and his attendants had wandered in the forest without seeing a human form but on the evening of the third they came to a cell in which they found a venerable hermit in the agonies of death applying rich cordials they brought the fainting man to his speech my sons said he i am bounden to your charitybut it is in vaini am going to my eternal restyet i die with the satisfaction of performing the will of heaven when first i repaired to this solitude after seeing my country become a prey to unbelieversit is alas above fifty years since i was witness to that dreadful scene st nicholas appeared to me and revealed a secret which he bade me never disclose to mortal man but on my,2

t frederic was destined by heaven to accomplish the fate that seemed to threaten her house looking with anxious fondness at matilda a silent tear stole down her cheek but recollecting herself she said proceed my lord heaven does nothing in vain mortals must receive its divine behests with lowliness and submission it is our part to deprecate its wrath or bow to its decrees repeat the sentence my lord we listen resigned frederic was grieved that he had proceeded so far the dignity and patient firmness of hippolita penetrated him with respect and the tender silent affection with which the princess and her daughter regarded each other melted him almost to tears yet apprehensive that his forbearance to obey would be more alarming he repeated in a faltering and low voice the following lines whereer a casque that suits this sword is found with perils is thy daughter compassd round alfonsos blood alone can save the maid and quiet a long restless princes shade wha,2
t is there in these lines said theodore impatiently that affects these princesses why were they to be shocked by a mysterious delicacy that has so little foundation your words are rude young man said the marquis and though fortune has favoured you once my honoured lord said isabella who resented theodores warmth which she perceived was dictated by his sentiments for matilda discompose not yourself for the glosing of a peasants son he forgets the reverence he owes you but he is not accustomed hippolita concerned at the heat that had arisen checked theodore for his boldness but with an air acknowledging his zeal and changing the conversation demanded of frederic where he had left her lord as the marquis was going to reply they heard a noise without and rising to inquire the cause manfred jerome and part of the troop who had met an imperfect rumour of what had happened entered the chamber manfred advanced hastily towards frederics bed to condole with him on his misf,2
ortune and to learn the circumstances of the combat when starting in an agony of terror and amazement he cried ha what art thou thou dreadful spectre is my hour come my dearest gracious lord cried hippolita clasping him in her arms what is it you see why do you fix your eyeballs thus what cried manfred breathless dost thou see nothing hippolita is this ghastly phantom sent to me aloneto me who did not for mercys sweetest self my lord said hippolita resume your soul command your reason there is none here but us your friends what is not that alfonso cried manfred dost thou not see him can it be my brains delirium this my lord said hippolita this is theodore the youth who has been so unfortunate theodore said manfred mournfully and striking his forehead theodore or a phantom he has unhinged the soul of manfred but how comes he here and how comes he in armour i believe he went in search of isabella said hippolita of isabella,2
said manfred relapsing into rage yes yes that is not doubtful but how did he escape from durance in which i left him was it isabella or this hypocritical old friar that procured his enlargement and would a parent be criminal my lord said theodore if he meditated the deliverance of his child jerome amazed to hear himself in a manner accused by his son and without foundation knew not what to think he could not comprehend how theodore had escaped how he came to be armed and to encounter frederic still he would not venture to ask any questions that might tend to inflame manfreds wrath against his son jeromes silence convinced manfred that he had contrived theodores release and is it thus thou ungrateful old man said the prince addressing himself to the friar that thou repayest mine and hippolitas bounties and not content with traversing my hearts nearest wishes thou armest thy bastard and bringest him into my own castle to insult me my lord said theodore yo,2

hough under engagement to return to the castle on the morrow a condition the young man gladly accepted to retire with his father to the convent matilda and isabella were too much occupied with their own reflections and too little content with each other to wish for farther converse that night they separated each to her chamber with more expressions of ceremony and fewer of affection than had passed between them since their childhood if they parted with small cordiality they did but meet with greater impatience as soon as the sun was risen their minds were in a situation that excluded sleep and each recollected a thousand questions which she wished she had put to the other overnight matilda reflected that isabella had been twice delivered by theodore in very critical situations which she could not believe accidental his eyes it was true had been fixed on her in frederics chamber but that might have been to disguise his passion for isabella from the fathers of both it were better to clear,2
this up she wished to know the truth lest she should wrong her friend by entertaining a passion for isabellas lover thus jealousy prompted and at the same time borrowed an excuse from friendship to justify its curiosity isabella not less restless had better foundation for her suspicions both theodores tongue and eyes had told her his heart was engaged it was trueyet perhaps matilda might not correspond to his passion she had ever appeared insensible to love all her thoughts were set on heaven why did i dissuade her said isabella to herself i am punished for my generosity but when did they meet where it cannot be i have deceived myself perhaps last night was the first time they ever beheld each other it must be some other object that has prepossessed his affectionsif it is i am not so unhappy as i thought if it is not my friend matildahow can i stoop to wish for the affection of a man who rudely and unnecessarily acquainted me with his indifference and that at the very mome,2

ot think i am such a stranger to filial tenderness as not to resent the boldness of that audacious youth and that it is impossible for me ever to feel any affection for one who dared to lift his arm against the author of my being no matilda my heart abhors him and if you still retain the friendship for me that you have vowed from your infancy you will detest a man who has been on the point of making me miserable for ever matilda held down her head and replied i hope my dearest isabella does not doubt her matildas friendship i never beheld that youth until yesterday he is almost a stranger to me but as the surgeons have pronounced your father out of danger you ought not to harbour uncharitable resentment against one who i am persuaded did not know the marquis was related to you you plead his cause very pathetically said isabella considering he is so much a stranger to you i am mistaken or he returns your charity what mean you said matilda nothing said isabella repenting t,2
hat she had given matilda a hint of theodores inclination for her then changing the discourse she asked matilda what occasioned manfred to take theodore for a spectre bless me said matilda did not you observe his extreme resemblance to the portrait of alfonso in the gallery i took notice of it to bianca even before i saw him in armour but with the helmet on he is the very image of that picture i do not much observe pictures said isabella much less have i examined this young man so attentively as you seem to have done ah matilda your heart is in danger but let me warn you as a friend he has owned to me that he is in love it cannot be with you for yesterday was the first time you ever metwas it not certainly replied matilda but why does my dearest isabella conclude from anything i have said thatshe pausedthen continuing he saw you first and i am far from having the vanity to think that my little portion of charms could engage a heart devoted to you may you be happy,2
isabella whatever is the fate of matilda my lovely friend said isabella whose heart was too honest to resist a kind expression it is you that theodore admires i saw it i am persuaded of it nor shall a thought of my own happiness suffer me to interfere with yours this frankness drew tears from the gentle matilda and jealousy that for a moment had raised a coolness between these amiable maidens soon gave way to the natural sincerity and candour of their souls each confessed to the other the impression that theodore had made on her and this confidence was followed by a struggle of generosity each insisting on yielding her claim to her friend at length the dignity of isabellas virtue reminding her of the preference which theodore had almost declared for her rival made her determine to conquer her passion and cede the beloved object to her friend during this contest of amity hippolita entered her daughters chamber madam said she to isabella you have so much tenderness for matilda,2

iscover his sons inclination for that princess and leaving him to his rest promised in the morning to acquaint him with important reasons for conquering his passion theodore like isabella was too recently acquainted with parental authority to submit to its decisions against the impulse of his heart he had little curiosity to learn the friars reasons and less disposition to obey them the lovely matilda had made stronger impressions on him than filial affection all night he pleased himself with visions of love and it was not till late after the morningoffice that he recollected the friars commands to attend him at alfonsos tomb young man said jerome when he saw him this tardiness does not please me have a fathers commands already so little weight theodore made awkward excuses and attributed his delay to having overslept himself and on whom were thy dreams employed said the friar sternly his son blushed come come resumed the friar inconsiderate youth this must not be,2

e with the usurper of his right but nothing could equal the perplexity of the friar when hippolita confessed her readiness not to oppose the separation and demanded his opinion on the legality of her acquiescence the friar caught eagerly at her request of his advice and without explaining his aversion to the proposed marriage of manfred and isabella he painted to hippolita in the most alarming colours the sinfulness of her consent denounced judgments against her if she complied and enjoined her in the severest terms to treat any such proposition with every mark of indignation and refusal manfred in the meantime had broken his purpose to frederic and proposed the double marriage that weak prince who had been struck with the charms of matilda listened but too eagerly to the offer he forgot his enmity to manfred whom he saw but little hope of dispossessing by force and flattering himself that no issue might succeed from the union of his daughter with the tyrant he looked upon his own successi,2
on to the principality as facilitated by wedding matilda he made faint opposition to the proposal affecting for form only not to acquiesce unless hippolita should consent to the divorce manfred took that upon himself transported with his success and impatient to see himself in a situation to expect sons he hastened to his wifes apartment determined to extort her compliance he learned with indignation that she was absent at the convent his guilt suggested to him that she had probably been informed by isabella of his purpose he doubted whether her retirement to the convent did not import an intention of remaining there until she could raise obstacles to their divorce and the suspicions he had already entertained of jerome made him apprehend that the friar would not only traverse his views but might have inspired hippolita with the resolution of taking sanctuary impatient to unravel this clue and to defeat its success manfred hastened to the convent and arrived there as the friar was earnes,2
tly exhorting the princess never to yield to the divorce madam said manfred what business drew you hither why did you not await my return from the marquis i came to implore a blessing on your councils replied hippolita my councils do not need a friars intervention said manfred and of all men living is that hoary traitor the only one whom you delight to confer with profane prince said jerome is it at the altar that thou choosest to insult the servants of the altarbut manfred thy impious schemes are known heaven and this virtuous lady know themnay frown not prince the church despises thy menaces her thunders will be heard above thy wrath dare to proceed in thy cursed purpose of a divorce until her sentence be known and here i lance her anathema at thy head audacious rebel said manfred endeavouring to conceal the awe with which the friars words inspired him dost thou presume to threaten thy lawful prince thou art no lawful prince said jerome thou art n,2

re but jeromes new presumption so dissonant from his former meekness suggested still deeper apprehensions the prince even suspected that the friar depended on some secret support from frederic whose arrival coinciding with the novel appearance of theodore seemed to bespeak a correspondence still more was he troubled with the resemblance of theodore to alfonsos portrait the latter he knew had unquestionably died without issue frederic had consented to bestow isabella on him these contradictions agitated his mind with numberless pangs he saw but two methods of extricating himself from his difficulties the one was to resign his dominions to the marquispride ambition and his reliance on ancient prophecies which had pointed out a possibility of his preserving them to his posterity combated that thought the other was to press his marriage with isabella after long ruminating on these anxious thoughts as he marched silently with hippolita to the castle he at last discoursed with that princess,2
on the subject of his disquiet and used every insinuating and plausible argument to extract her consent to even her promise of promoting the divorce hippolita needed little persuasions to bend her to his pleasure she endeavoured to win him over to the measure of resigning his dominions but finding her exhortations fruitless she assured him that as far as her conscience would allow she would raise no opposition to a separation though without better founded scruples than what he yet alleged she would not engage to be active in demanding it this compliance though inadequate was sufficient to raise manfreds hopes he trusted that his power and wealth would easily advance his suit at the court of rome whither he resolved to engage frederic to take a journey on purpose that prince had discovered so much passion for matilda that manfred hoped to obtain all he wished by holding out or withdrawing his daughters charms according as the marquis should appear more or less disposed to cooperate in hi,2
s views even the absence of frederic would be a material point gained until he could take further measures for his security dismissing hippolita to her apartment he repaired to that of the marquis but crossing the great hall through which he was to pass he met bianca the damsel he knew was in the confidence of both the young ladies it immediately occurred to him to sift her on the subject of isabella and theodore calling her aside into the recess of the oriel window of the hall and soothing her with many fair words and promises he demanded of her whether she knew aught of the state of isabellas affections i my lord no my lordyes my lordpoor lady she is wonderfully alarmed about her fathers wounds but i tell her he will do well dont your highness think so i do not ask you replied manfred what she thinks about her father but you are in her secrets come be a good girl and tell me is there any young manhayou understand me lord bless me understand your highness no not,2
i i told her a few vulnerary herbs and repose i am not talking replied the prince impatiently about her father i know he will do well bless me i rejoice to hear your highness say so for though i thought it not right to let my young lady despond methought his greatness had a wan look and a somethingi remember when young ferdinand was wounded by the venetian thou answerest from the point interrupted manfred but here take this jewel perhaps that may fix thy attentionnay no reverences my favour shall not stop herecome tell me truly how stands isabellas heart well your highness has such a way said bianca to be surebut can your highness keep a secret if it should ever come out of your lips it shall not it shall not cried manfred nay but swear your highness by my halidame if it should ever be known that i said it why truth is truth i do not think my lady isabella ever much affectioned my young lord your son yet he was a sweet youth as one should,2

m going to visit the marquis and will talk further with thee at my return manfred after some general conversation desired frederic to dismiss the two knights his companions having to talk with him on urgent affairs as soon as they were alone he began in artful guise to sound the marquis on the subject of matilda and finding him disposed to his wish he let drop hints on the difficulties that would attend the celebration of their marriage unlessat that instant bianca burst into the room with a wildness in her look and gestures that spoke the utmost terror oh my lord my lord cried she we are all undone it is come again it is come again what is come again cried manfred amazed oh the hand the giant the handsupport me i am terrified out of my senses cried bianca i will not sleep in the castle tonight where shall i go my things may come after me tomorrowwould i had been content to wed francesco this comes of ambition what has terrified thee thus young woman s,2

no trifles the enormous sabre i was directed to in the wood yon casque its felloware these visions of this poor maidens brain so jaquez thinks may it please your greatness said bianca he says this moon will not be out without our seeing some strange revolution for my part i should not be surprised if it was to happen tomorrow for as i was saying when i heard the clattering of armour i was all in a cold sweat i looked up and if your greatness will believe me i saw upon the uppermost banister of the great stairs a hand in armour as big as big i thought i should have swooned i never stopped until i came hitherwould i were well out of this castle my lady matilda told me but yestermorning that her highness hippolita knows something thou art an insolent cried manfred lord marquis it much misgives me that this scene is concerted to affront me are my own domestics suborned to spread tales injurious to my honour pursue your claim by manly daring or let us bury our feuds as w,2
as proposed by the intermarriage of our children but trust me it ill becomes a prince of your bearing to practise on mercenary wenches i scorn your imputation said frederic until this hour i never set eyes on this damsel i have given her no jewel my lord my lord your conscience your guilt accuses you and would throw the suspicion on me but keep your daughter and think no more of isabella the judgments already fallen on your house forbid me matching into it manfred alarmed at the resolute tone in which frederic delivered these words endeavoured to pacify him dismissing bianca he made such submissions to the marquis and threw in such artful encomiums on matilda that frederic was once more staggered however as his passion was of so recent a date it could not at once surmount the scruples he had conceived he had gathered enough from biancas discourse to persuade him that heaven declared itself against manfred the proposed marriages too removed his claim to a distance and the pr,2
incipality of otranto was a stronger temptation than the contingent reversion of it with matilda still he would not absolutely recede from his engagements but purposing to gain time he demanded of manfred if it was true in fact that hippolita consented to the divorce the prince transported to find no other obstacle and depending on his influence over his wife assured the marquis it was so and that he might satisfy himself of the truth from her own mouth as they were thus discoursing word was brought that the banquet was prepared manfred conducted frederic to the great hall where they were received by hippolita and the young princesses manfred placed the marquis next to matilda and seated himself between his wife and isabella hippolita comported herself with an easy gravity but the young ladies were silent and melancholy manfred who was determined to pursue his point with the marquis in the remainder of the evening pushed on the feast until it waxed late affecting unrestrained gaiety and,2
plying frederic with repeated goblets of wine the latter more upon his guard than manfred wished declined his frequent challenges on pretence of his late loss of blood while the prince to raise his own disordered spirits and to counterfeit unconcern indulged himself in plentiful draughts though not to the intoxication of his senses the evening being far advanced the banquet concluded manfred would have withdrawn with frederic but the latter pleading weakness and want of repose retired to his chamber gallantly telling the prince that his daughter should amuse his highness until himself could attend him manfred accepted the party and to the no small grief of isabella accompanied her to her apartment matilda waited on her mother to enjoy the freshness of the evening on the ramparts of the castle soon as the company were dispersed their several ways frederic quitting his chamber inquired if hippolita was alone and was told by one of her attendants who had not noticed her going forth th,2
at at that hour she generally withdrew to her oratory where he probably would find her the marquis during the repast had beheld matilda with increase of passion he now wished to find hippolita in the disposition her lord had promised the portents that had alarmed him were forgotten in his desires stealing softly and unobserved to the apartment of hippolita he entered it with a resolution to encourage her acquiescence to the divorce having perceived that manfred was resolved to make the possession of isabella an unalterable condition before he would grant matilda to his wishes the marquis was not surprised at the silence that reigned in the princesss apartment concluding her as he had been advertised in her oratory he passed on the door was ajar the evening gloomy and overcast pushing open the door gently he saw a person kneeling before the altar as he approached nearer it seemed not a woman but one in a long woollen weed whose back was towards him the person seemed absorbed in prayer,2
the marquis was about to return when the figure rising stood some moments fixed in meditation without regarding him the marquis expecting the holy person to come forth and meaning to excuse his uncivil interruption said reverend father i sought the lady hippolita hippolita replied a hollow voice camest thou to this castle to seek hippolita and then the figure turning slowly round discovered to frederic the fleshless jaws and empty sockets of a skeleton wrapt in a hermits cowl angels of grace protect me cried frederic recoiling deserve their protection said the spectre frederic falling on his knees adjured the phantom to take pity on him dost thou not remember me said the apparition remember the wood of joppa art thou that holy hermit cried frederic trembling can i do aught for thy eternal peace wast thou delivered from bondage said the spectre to pursue carnal delights hast thou forgotten the buried sabre and the behest of heaven engraven on,2
it i have not i have not said frederic but say blest spirit what is thy errand to me what remains to be done to forget matilda said the apparition and vanished frederics blood froze in his veins for some minutes he remained motionless then falling prostrate on his face before the altar he besought the intercession of every saint for pardon a flood of tears succeeded to this transport and the image of the beauteous matilda rushing in spite of him on his thoughts he lay on the ground in a conflict of penitence and passion ere he could recover from this agony of his spirits the princess hippolita with a taper in her hand entered the oratory alone seeing a man without motion on the floor she gave a shriek concluding him dead her fright brought frederic to himself rising suddenly his face bedewed with tears he would have rushed from her presence but hippolita stopping him conjured him in the most plaintive accents to explain the cause of his disorder and by what strange chan,2
ce she had found him there in that posture ah virtuous princess said the marquis penetrated with grief and stopped for the love of heaven my lord said hippolita disclose the cause of this transport what mean these doleful sounds this alarming exclamation on my name what woes has heaven still in store for the wretched hippolita yet silent by every pitying angel i adjure thee noble prince continued she falling at his feet to disclose the purport of what lies at thy heart i see thou feelest for me thou feelest the sharp pangs that thou inflictestspeak for pity does aught thou knowest concern my child i cannot speak cried frederic bursting from her oh matilda quitting the princess thus abruptly he hastened to his own apartment at the door of it he was accosted by manfred who flushed by wine and love had come to seek him and to propose to waste some hours of the night in music and revelling frederic offended at an invitation so dissonant from the mood of his soul,2
pushed him rudely aside and entering his chamber flung the door intemperately against manfred and bolted it inwards the haughty prince enraged at this unaccountable behaviour withdrew in a frame of mind capable of the most fatal excesses as he crossed the court he was met by the domestic whom he had planted at the convent as a spy on jerome and theodore this man almost breathless with the haste he had made informed his lord that theodore and some lady from the castle were at that instant in private conference at the tomb of alfonso in st nicholass church he had dogged theodore thither but the gloominess of the night had prevented his discovering who the woman was manfred whose spirits were inflamed and whom isabella had driven from her on his urging his passion with too little reserve did not doubt but the inquietude she had expressed had been occasioned by her impatience to meet theodore provoked by this conjecture and enraged at her father he hastened secretly to the great church,2
gliding softly between the aisles and guided by an imperfect gleam of moonshine that shone faintly through the illuminated windows he stole towards the tomb of alfonso to which he was directed by indistinct whispers of the persons he sought the first sounds he could distinguish were does it alas depend on me manfred will never permit our union no this shall prevent it cried the tyrant drawing his dagger and plunging it over her shoulder into the bosom of the person that spoke ah me i am slain cried matilda sinking good heaven receive my soul savage inhuman monster what hast thou done cried theodore rushing on him and wrenching his dagger from him stop stop thy impious hand cried matilda it is my father manfred waking as from a trance beat his breast twisted his hands in his locks and endeavoured to recover his dagger from theodore to despatch himself theodore scarce less distracted and only mastering the transports of his grief to assist matilda had,2
now by his cries drawn some of the monks to his aid while part of them endeavoured in concert with the afflicted theodore to stop the blood of the dying princess the rest prevented manfred from laying violent hands on himself matilda resigning herself patiently to her fate acknowledged with looks of grateful love the zeal of theodore yet oft as her faintness would permit her speech its way she begged the assistants to comfort her father jerome by this time had learnt the fatal news and reached the church his looks seemed to reproach theodore but turning to manfred he said now tyrant behold the completion of woe fulfilled on thy impious and devoted head the blood of alfonso cried to heaven for vengeance and heaven has permitted its altar to be polluted by assassination that thou mightest shed thy own blood at the foot of that princes sepulchre cruel man cried matilda to aggravate the woes of a parent may heaven bless my father and forgive him as i do my lord my gracious s,2

and then clasped them to her heart manfred could not support this act of pathetic piety he dashed himself on the ground and cursed the day he was born isabella apprehensive that these struggles of passion were more than matilda could support took upon herself to order manfred to be borne to his apartment while she caused matilda to be conveyed to the nearest chamber hippolita scarce more alive than her daughter was regardless of everything but her but when the tender isabellas care would have likewise removed her while the surgeons examined matildas wound she cried remove me never never i lived but in her and will expire with her matilda raised her eyes at her mothers voice but closed them again without speaking her sinking pulse and the damp coldness of her hand soon dispelled all hopes of recovery theodore followed the surgeons into the outer chamber and heard them pronounce the fatal sentence with a transport equal to frenzy since she cannot live mine cried he at least,2

r and great crony isaac sharpe he found his friend seated in the armchair by the chimney corner isaac being a bachelorman paid small heed to the refinements which were recently beginning to be in vogue among his class and habitually sat in the kitchen the old woman who acted as housekeeper to him had gone home and he was alone in the wide flagged room which looked cheerful enough just now lit up as it was by the wood fire which danced gaily on the yellow walls and threw gigantic shadows of the hams and flitches suspended from the great oaken beams on the ceiling he was just in the act of shaking out the ashes from his pipe previous to retiring for the night when elias entered and greeted him with no small astonishment be it you lias i were just agoin to lock up and go to roost elias creaked noisily across the great kitchen and standing opposite sharpe in the chimney corner looked down at him for a moment without speaking the other tapped his pipe on the iron hob nearest,0
him and continued to gaze interrogatively at the newcomer he was about the same age as fiander but looked younger his burly form being straight and his sunburnt face more lightly touched by the hand of time hair beard and whiskers alike abundant were of a uniform pepperandsaltthere being more pepper than salt in the mixture when he smiled he displayed a set of teeth in no less excellent preservation as elias continued to gaze down at him with an odd sheepish expression and without speaking he himself took the initiative ye called round to tell me about the sale i suppose well i take it very kind of ye lias though i was nt for your goin after that newfangled machine i do low yell ha give a big price for t his tone had a tinge of severity and it was noticeable throughout that his attitude towards fiander was somewhat dictatorial though in truth fiander was the older as well as the richer man nay now nay now the latter returned quickly ye be wrong for once isaa,0

ter ii the time ive lost in wooing in watching and pursuing the light that lies in womans eyes has been my hearts undoing thomas moore the subject of the conversation recently recorded was slowly removing her blacks and laying them carefully away on the lavenderscented shelves in the desolate upper chamber of the home which had suddenly grown so lonely divested of the flowing mantle the tall wellmoulded figure was set off by its closefitting black robe and the face which had been hidden from view by the thick folds of crape proved able to stand the test of the glaring summer sunshine the adjective plain applied to the widow by her late husbands friend must be taken only in its local sense as signifying simple and straightforward even to the indifferent eyes of this elderly yeoman rosalies beauty had ripened and increased during the four years that had elapsed since her marriage with,0
his friend the black lashes which shaded her lovely eyes were still wet the red lips quivered and the bosom heaved convulsively most of the friends and neighbours of the late mr fiander would have been astonishednot to say scandalisedat the sight of such grief it was quite decent and becoming to cry in church where everybody was looking at you but to cry when you were alone for an old man of sixtytwowhen you had been left in undisputed possession of all his property and might with perfect impunity marry again at the earliest possible opportunityit was not only unreasonable and foolish but rank ingratitude for the most merciful dispensation of providence but mrs fiander continued to sob to herself and to look blankly round the empty room and out at the wide fields where the familiar figure had been wont to roam and when taking the new widows cap from its box she arranged it on the top of her abundant hair she could not repress a fresh gush of tears poor fiander she said to herse,0

e wondered idly if mr sharpe would come today she almost hoped he would she did not like to walk round the fields alonepeople would think it strange tooand it was so lonely and so dreary sitting by herself in the house but mr sharpes chair remained empty all that afternoon mrs fiander however had other visitors it was getting near teatime and she was looking forward somewhat anxiously to the arrival of that meal which would make a break in the dismal hours when a genteel knock at the door startled her she knew it was not isaac for it was his custom to walk in uninvited and thought it might be some other neighbour coming with a word of comfort she was surprised however when the maid ushered in a tall stout young man whom she recognised as the son of one of the leading tradespeople in the town andrew burges father was indeed not only cab and coach proprietor on a large scale but also undertaker and rosalie now remembered that her actual visitor had taken a prominent part at,0

ut i should have thought it a privilege to drive you mrs fiander rosalie made some inarticulate rejoinder i thought id just call round and explain my motives he went on and also take the opportunity of offering in person my best condoliences thank you said rosalie i may speak i think remarked andrew pompously in the name of the whole borough of branston there was i might say but one mournful murmur when the noos of his death came to town but one mournful murmur i do assure ee mrs fiander rosalie looked up gratefully the young man certainly meant well and this information was gratifying she felt a little thrill of melancholy pleasure at the thought of the universal esteem and respect in which her poor elias had been held but meeting the hard expressionless gaze of mr burges tight little eyes the appreciative compliment died upon her lips so now resumed the visitor diving for his hat and carefully tucking away the handkerchief in its liningnow mrs fiande,0

oh this is quite an informal visit mrs fiander not at all official i came of my own accordi may say in my private capacity this here is nt a sixandeightpenny affair he he oh said rosalie even more drily than before no seeing mrs fiander that you are left so peculiarly lonely and desolate i just thought to myself that it would be only kind to call in in passing and mention that your business matters mrs fiander are in a most satisfactory position i have frequently heard our firm remark that they seldom had to deal with affairs more satisfactory and straightforward my husband had a very clear head for business said mrs fiander i always found that t is nt that alone rejoined the young man it is if i may be permitted to express an opinion the very satisfactory manner in which he has disposed of his property on which i feel bound to congratulate you i called round private as i say jist to let you know as all was most satisfactory thank you i ha,0
d no doubt about it said rosalie surveying her visitor with increasing disfavour as he leered at her from the depth of isaacs capacious chair ladies he pursued with an ingratiating wriggleladies is apt to be easily alarmed when legal matters is under discussion the very terms which come so natural to us are apt to frighten them lor bless you i dessay when mr robinson do talk about testamentary dispositions and such like it makes you feel quite nervous but t is only the sound of the words as is strange the thing itself meaning the testamentary dispositions of the late lamented mr fiander is i do assure you most satisfactory what with the freehold property meanin the farm and the money invested in such good and safe securitiesyou may be sure that they are good and safe mrs fiander for i may ventur to tell you in confidence that the late lamented used to consult our firm with regard to his investmentsi have pleasure in assuring you that very few ladies find theirselves in s,0
o satisfactory a position as you do find yourself today i jist dropped in unofficial like to let you know this for as i said to myself it may be a satisfaction to pore mrs fiander to know her circumstances and to understand that desolate as she may be left there is some compensations and that moreover she has been left absolutely free and independent the late lamented not having hampered her by no conditions whatever here mr cross who had been leaning forward in his chair so that his face with its narrow jaws and its little twinkling eyes had been a good deal below the level of the slightly disdainful countenance of his hostess now slowly straightened himself clapped an exultant hand on either knee and brought the jaws aforesaid together with a snap mrs fiander could not help contrasting him once more with the friend who should by right be sitting opposite to her how far more welcome would have been the sight of the goodtempered rubicund visage the placid portly form even th,0
e contented amicable taciturnity which mr sharpe usually maintained during the greater part of his visits would have been far more to her mind than this loquacity which somehow seemed unpleasantly near familiarity still it was unreasonable to take a dislike to the poor young man merely because he looked like a weasel and was disposed to be a little overfriendly no doubt his intention was kind she thanked him therefore with somewhat forced politeness but could not repress a little forward movement in her chair which a sensitive person would have recognized as a token of dismissal mr cross was not however of this calibre and prolonged his visit until his hostesss patience fairly wore out she rose at last glancing at the clock and observing that she thought it was time to get ready for evening church i will have the pleasure of escorting you announced samuel promptly and cheerfully thereupon mrs fiander sat down again on second thoughts im too tired she said but i will not,0
allow you to delay any longer mr crossyou will certainly be late as it is he had no course but to withdraw then which he did unwillingly enough after tenderly pressing the widows hand and assuring her quite superfluously that she might depend on him to look after her interests in every way in his power rosalie was disconsolately polishing the hand which had received this undesired token of interest when the door creaked slowly open and a tall gaunt elderly female clad in rusty black and wearing somewhat on the back of her head a flat black bonnet with the strings untied entered the room this was mrs greene a personage generally to be met with in this neighbourhood in households whose number had recently been either increased or diminished she was equally at home as she once remarked with babies and with corpses and she filled up the intervals by charing her appearance was so genteel and her manner of fulfilling her various duties so elegant that the clergymans daughter h,0
ad once remarked that she was wonderfully refined for a charwoman the appellation had stuck to her and she was commonly known as the refined charwoman among such of the gentry as occasionally employed her in that capacity she had come to littlecomb farm to lay out poor elias fiander and she was remaining on as chief factotum and comforter for it was nt to be supposed that the poor young widow ud be eqal to lookin after the maidsmuch less to turn her thoughts to doin for herself she now advanced slowly to the table and after heaving a deep sigh proceeded to lay the cloth rosalie knew that she was burning to enter into conversation but was too much dispirited to encourage her but byandby after a preliminary cough mrs greene remarked in a lugubrious tone thats a lovely cap mum everybody was asayin that you did look charmin in your weeds ay that was what they said she do look charmingthat was the very thing they said t is a comfort too says they to see h,0
ow nice she do mourn for mr fiander they was all apassing the remark one to the other about it mumadmirable they said it was nonsense cried rosalie wrathfully but with a little quaver in her voice it would be very strange i think if i did not grieve for such a good husband i wish people would nt talk about me she added petulantly talk ejaculated mrs greene dismally ah they will talk mum you may depend on it theyll alays talk and perticlarly about a young widow lord how they did go on about me when poor greene died they did nt leave so much as my furnitur alone whether i could afford to keep it or whether id be for ridden house and goin into lodgins and whether id put the children in an orphanage and get married againit was enough to drive a body silly the way they did go on disgusting cried rosalie now faintly interested the idea of talking of a second marriage when your poor husband was only just dead why that be the first thing theyd ta,0
lk on with a kind of dismal triumphmore perticlar if a woman be young and goodlookin in your own case mum i do assure ye they be all apickin out your second ah thats what they be adoin but as they all picks different men they dont so very well agree mrs greene ejaculated her mistress indignantly wheeling round in her chair what do you mean how dare you come and repeat such things to meits positively indecent that be the very remark as i did pass myself to the men yesterday retorted mrs greene pausing to contemplate mrs fiander with her hands upon her hips the very thing t is most onbecomin says i to be settin yourselves up to pry into the affairs o your betters missus says i be athinkin of nothing but her mournin so far and when she do make her chice says i shell please herself and pick out him as is most suitable them was my words mum well cried rosalie rising to her feet impetuously i wonder you dare to own them to me mr,0
s greene i think that considering you are a widow yourself you ought to know better than to accuse another woman of such faithlessness if you think i could ever ever forget my good kind husband you are much mistaken mrs greene coughed drily behind her hand why should i marry again any more than you cried rosalie with angry tears starting to her eyes well mum the cases be very different nobody never axed it was nt very likely as they should considering i had six children and only my own labour to keep em as for you mum nobody could nt think it at all strange if you was to get married againconsiderin everything you know your station in life continued mrs greene delicately and your not bein blessed with no children and your fortun and your oncommon looksit ud be very strange if there was nt amany acoming coortin yeand you may depend upon it they will she cried with conviction and seein how young you be mum and how lonesome like i should say it be,0
amost your dooty to take a second now listen to me mrs greene said rosalie very emphatically i wish to put an end to this foolish gossip at once you can tell everybody that you hear talking about the matter that i never intend to marry again neverdo you hear me yes mum returned mrs greene with every feature and line of her countenance expressing disbelief i hear praps i better begin by lettin them two chaps know what called here today i do low theyll be disappinted i wish you would nt talk such nonsense mrs greene cried rosalie almost pettishly though the colour rushed over her face and a startled expression showed itself for a moment in her heavy eyes go away i dont want to be worried any more remember what i have said thats all chapter iii nothing coming nothing going landrail craking one cock crowing few things moving up and down all things drowsy northcount,0
ry song rosalie passed a very unquiet night and woke from a troubled sleep shortly after dawn the deadweight of grief ever present to her since her bereavement was now as she dimly felt supplemented by something elsesomething irritating something unpleasant as her scattered faculties returned to her she gradually recognised that this state of feeling was produced by several small causes the two visits which she had received yesterday and which she had supposed to proceed from mere officious goodwill had as she now acknowledged been prompted in all probability by aspirations as unjustifiable as they were unseemly her subsequent interview with mrs greene had disagreeably enlightened her on this point and had also made her aware of the kind of gossip to which she must expect to be subjected thenall through that long lonely heavy day isaac sharpe had not once put in an appearance he her husbands faithful friend the only real friend whom she herself acknowledged had not thought f,0
it to look in for so much as five minutes to cheer her in her desolation as she thought of these things hot tears welled afresh to her eyes oh how desolate she was no one really cared for her and what was almost worse no one seemed to believe in the sincerity of her affliction as she lay tossing uneasily on her pillow and as the light grew and brightened and the birds jubilant songs mingled with the distant lowing of cows a new sense of disquietude came to her proceeding from a different and very tangible cause it was broad daymonday morninga morning of exceptional importance at the farmand no human being seemed yet to be afoot reaching up her hand to the oldfashioned watchpocket which hung in the centre of the bed she took down eliass heavy silver repeater and pressed the spring ting ting ting ting ting five oclock sitting up she sent the two cases flying open and gazed almost incredulously at the dial beneath ten minutes past fiveno less she sprang out of,0
bed and flung open her door jane susan what are you about t is past five oclock and churning morning how did you come to oversleep yourselves like that there was a muffled murmur a thud upon the floor a pat pat of bare feet across the room above and a door overhead opened was ye callin mum was i calling i should think i was calling have you forgotten what morning it is nay missus that i havent lord no t was this day seennight as poor master was buried dear yes so t was a lump rose in rosalies throat but she steadied her voice and said coldly i am not talking of that it is churning morning as you know very well you should have been up and about an hour ago make as much haste as you can now and come down she closed the door with just sufficient noise to indicate the condition of her feelings and hastened across the room to the open window drawing the curtains apart she looked out a glorious summers day not a cloud upon the pearl,0
yblue expanse of sky the leaves stirring gently in a fresh breezea breeze laden with all the exquisite spicy scents of morning the fragrance of dewy grasses of sunkissed trees of newlyawakened flowers the monthly rosetree climbing round her mullioned window thrust its delicate clusters of bloom almost into rosalies face but she pushed it impatiently aside her eyes cast a keen glance on the homely scene beyond above the timeworn roofs of the farmbuildings where the green of the moss and the mellow red and yellow of the tiles were alike transfigured by this mystic glow she could see last years ricks shouldering each other their regular outlines defined as it were with a pencil of fire the great meadow beyond which sloped downwards till it reached the churchyard wall a quarter of a mile away broke into light ripples tawny and russet as the breeze swept over it surely these were sights to gladden a young hearteven a heart that had been sorrowingyet the expression of rosalies ey,0
es grew more and more discontented and displeased and a frown gathered on her brow the fowl were flocking impatiently about the gate of the great barnyard yonder on the further side from beneath the tiled roof of the line of pigsties she could hear loud vociferations turning her eyes towards the stablebuildings which ran at right angles to them she could see that the doors were fast closed and could hear the rattling of chains and stamping of heavy hoofs within the church meadow ought to have been cut todaythe grass was overripe as it was men and horses should have been at work since three oclock no figures appeared even in the neighbourhood of the barn and looking beyond to the barton proper she could see that it was empty no wonder that the lowing of the cows had sounded distant in her ears they were still in their pasture by the river poor creatures crowding round the gate no doubt as the fowl were doing close at hand all clamouring alike for the attention which was evidently,0
withheld from them what was everyone about why had not the men come to their work as usual she performed her toilet hastily and somewhat perfunctorily and when at last a sleepylooking redhaired man came slouching up the lane which led to the farm he was surprised to see a figure in rustling print and broadbrimmed chip hat standing in the midst of a bevy of cocks and hens scattering handfuls of grain with wide impetuous sweeps of a round vigorous arm hallo whats the hurry sukey he inquired pleasantly but the face which was flashed upon him was not the rosy and somewhat vacant one of susan but belonged to no less a person than missus herself whats the hurry job she repeated severely i should like to know why there is nt a little more hurry what has become of all the men has anybody gone to fetch the cows what is everyone about i say job tilted his hat a little sideways on his red locks the better to scratch his head and gazed at his mistress with a puzzled and som,0

and then go and fetch the cows as she turned to reenter the house she caught sight of susan who was evidently exchanging astonished and depreciatory grimaces with job while mrs greene in the background was raising hands and eyes to heaven come get to work she cried sharply skim the cream susan and you jane get the churn ready well mrs greene what are you staring at have you never seen me work before that the fact of my turning up my sleeves need astonish you so much i suppose you can find something to do about the house give me that other skimmer jane ho dear yes mum i can find a plenty to do about this here house i wur but alookin at you mum because it do really seem amost too much for flesh an blood to be atakin on itself as you be atakin on yourself now mum dear yes but its to be hoped as ye wont overtax your constitootion mrs fiander go and clean the kitchen grate said rosalie beginning to skim with great rapidity and decision and see,0
that you blacklead it properly ho yes mum ill blacklead it returned the elder matron without however attempting to move from the spot where she stood and continuing to fix her eyes mournfully on her mistressill blacklead it right enough she repeated with a kind of groan after a pause during which she had meditatively polished first one skinny bare arm and then the other with a not overclean apron well why in heavens name dont you go then cried rosalie impatiently for she felt mrs greenes sorrowfully disapproving gaze right at the back of her head i be going mum i be going if i mid take the liberty of remindin you mumt is your hat as youve agot on your head well inquired rosalie reddening ominously well mrs fiander returned the charwoman with an insinuating smile would nt you like me to run upstairs wi it now and fetch you down your cap no replied her mistress very shortly if i had wished for it i should have sent for it you nee,0
d not be so officious the strings would get in my way while i worked she added a little inconsequently she felt she was lowering herself by making this explanation yet she could not bear that even mrs greene and the two maids should think her wanting in respect to eliass memory mrs greene withdrew murmuring under her breath that it was to be oped as nobody would nt chance t look in that morning which was not indeed very likely the hands of the oldfashioned clock in the kitchen beyond just pointing to the quarterpast six for some minutes nothing was heard but the clinking of the skimmers against the sides of the vats as the rich cream clotted and crinkled and thick was removed therefrom the scene was a pretty one indeed such a dairy on such a summers morning must always hold a charm and a picturesqueness of its own and now that the angular presence of mrs greene was removed there was absolutely no discordant element in this cool harmony the dairy itself was a wide pleasant r,0

ittle stiffly and she went out of the house and across the yard without speaking again except to say goodbye at the gate the downs were now all bathed with the light of the sinking sun and the topmost branches of the hedges which bordered the cornfields seemed turned to gold while the banks beneath had begun already to assume the deeper tint that spoke of gathering dewdew that the morning light would turn to a very sheet of silver but rosalie could only see the beauties of the world without through a mist of crape and tears i have not a friend in the world she said to herself not one isaac would nt even take the trouble to walk a quarter of a mile to see how i was getting on after following his advice he is only coming on sunday as a sort of duty not because he wants to well never mind i will show him and everyone that i can look after myself i want nobodys pretended pity since nobody really cares and she held up her head beneath its heavy veil and went on her way with a statel,0

you are late and i shall deduct from your pay a certain amount for every hour that you wilfully waste in fact for the future your wage shall be in exact proportion to the work you do the men stared gaped and looked sullenly first at one another and then at their mistress do you understand she inquired sharply job hunt his redbearded face even more glowing than usual answered in surly tones for himself and comrades nay missus us cant say as we do well then ill make it clear to you rang out the brisk young voice you are paid for the work you do during certain hours and if you dont come here punctually or if you waste any of those hours i shall deduct from your weekly wage the value of the lost timei shant pay you in fact for work you dont do nay now responded job rolling his head from side to side and assuming a bullying air i dont hold wi these here reglations us dont want no new rules do us mates nay that we dont came the answer in a ch,0
orus of growls whether you want them or not i mean to keep to them returned rosalie that will do you can all go to work now she turned and went into the house her heart was beating very fast and she was rather white about the lips but she had borne herself bravely and no one would have guessed the difficulty she had found in nerving herself to take this stand she could hear the mens voices murmuring together discontentedly but byandby the sound of heavy slouching steps moving away in different directions warned her that the group had dispersed it being the morning for cheesemaking she presently went upstairs to change her imposing black robe for her working dress and chancing as she came downstairs to look out of the window she observed that job hunt was standing arms akimbo by the pigsties in close conversation with his brother now job should at that moment have been far on his way to the pasture abel ought to have been feeding the pigs this was palpable defiance dee,0
ds not words said rosalie to herself they think i am merely threateningi must show them i am in earnest she went across the yard notebook in hand it is now halfpast five she remarked you job are two hours and a half late you abel an hour i have made a note of the time moreover if i find that you continue to disobey me i shall not keep you in my service job made an indescribable sound between a snort and a groan and slowly walked away abel however continued to stare darkly at his mistress without changing his position as rosalie now thoroughly incensed was about to pour out upon him the vials of her wrath she suddenly perceivedthe fact being unmistakably impressed upon herthat the pigsties near which she stood were in a most disgraceful condition abel she said when were these sties cleaned out not i am sure on saturday i weremortal busy o saturday returned abel in sepulchral tones why were you more busy last saturday than on any other saturda,0
y abel shuffled from one foot to the other and repeated sulkily that he had been mortal busy you must clean them as soon as ever you have fed the pigs said rosalie sharply t is enough to bring fever to the place to have them in this state pigs is nt pison responded abel roughly do not attempt to answer me back like that she cried it must be very bad for the poor animals themselves get to work without a moments delay saturday is the day growled the man imblowed if i clean em out afore saturday mind what you are about said his mistress sternly uplifting a warning forefinger i will not put up with impertinence or disobedience saturday is the day shouted abel and the shuffling movement became so violent and rapid that he actually seemed to dance this will never do said rosalie i see i must make a change at once abel hunt i give you notice to leave on saturday week one change be enough for me widow fiander retorted abel uplifting his v,0
oice as though his mistress stood a hundred yards away from him instead of barely two rosalies lips quivered t is your own fault she cried passionately if you behave in this way i must make an example of you unless you do as i tell you you must go im danged if i do clean the pigs out afore saturday shrieked abel and he threw his hat upon the ground waved his arms and stamped about like a maniac i dont want no danged womenfolk to come aorderin o me and here abel relieved his feelings by what isaac sharpe would delicately call a bit o language clean your pigs yourself widow fiander one change be enough for me notice me so much as ever ye like ill not clean them pigs out afore saturday then came a little more language and so on da capo never had such an experience fallen to rosalies lot before neither her kind old grandfather nor her doting husband had ever given her a rough word while they lived her subordinates had invariably obeyed her orders with al,0
acrity and treated her personally with respect the sound of abels strident tones the sight of his inflamed face above all the words he used and the insolence of his manner positively frightened her she turned pale trembledthen making a valiant effort to stand her ground threw out her hand as though to command silence but as abel continued to dance and rave sheer physical terror overcame her and she suddenly turned and fled her heart thumping violently against her ribs the tearsnever very far off during these first days of her bereavementspringing to her eyes she rushed upstairs to her room and flung herself across the bed burying her face in the pillow in an agony of humiliation what a fool i am what a miserable fool to be afraid of that wretched booby how can i ever hope to rule these people if i show the white feather at the outset now of course they will think that theyve only got to bully me and i shall at once give in oh fool fool to give way to silly womanish f,0
ears at such a moment oh oh how shall i ever look them in the face she continued to roll her head on the pillow for some moments her cheeks had now become burning and her heart still beat fast no longer with terror but with anger byandby she sat up pushed back her hair and shook out the folds of her dress after all t is never too late to mend she said to herself she went downstairs and into the dairy directing her maids somewhat sharply and setting about her own work with flushed cheeks and a serious face in course of time her agitation subsided and after her solitary breakfast she was quite herself again at noon as she passed through the kitchen to the parlour she chanced to glance through the open door and observed that the men had gathered together in the yard and were eagerly talking instead of making their way homewards or retiring to the barn to eat their dinners she feigned to pay no attention to them however and walked on to her own quarters presently she b,0
ecame aware that the whole body was advancing towards the house and a moment later susan thrust in her round face at the door please mum the men be wishin to speak a few words with ee very well said rosalie i will go out to them on reaching the threshold of the outer door she paused looking round on the group and waiting for them to take the initiative job was as before the first to speak i be come to tell ee mrs fiander as i wish to notice ye for saturday week these here changes baint to my likin and the mistress baint to my likin so yell please to suit yourself by that time mum he spoke gruffly and eyed her impertinently but this time she did not flinch very well job she said i have no doubt i shall be able to do so without any difficulty abel was the next to advance but rosalie waved him aside as it has already been settled that you are to leave she remarked you can have nothing to say to me step back now who comes next james bundy i,0

in that part of the world well sam said rosalie kindly as though to help him out sam was the chief of the three dairy chaps a goodlooking young fellow of about fourandtwenty with a dark goodhumoured countenance and a certain jaunty air as he now advanced a smile flashed suddenly over his face his white teeth gleaming out pleasantly mum he said mummrs fiander she smiled too well sam what have you got to say the usual thing i suppose no mumnot at all mum iwish to say as i havent got no fault to find at all mum ill come in better time tomorrow morn an yell not have to speak to me agen mum very good said rosalie in a different tone at this unexpected speech a lump came in her throat but she choked it down have the others got anything to say she inquired because if so i hope they will make haste and say it my dinner will be getting cold the men who had not hitherto spoken looked at each other uncertainly their glances finall,0
y resting on the beaming countenance of sam belbin after all had he not chosen the better part i do agree with he said one under his breath and then another byandby all remarked aloud somewhat falteringly that they just thought they would mention their wish to give more satisfaction in the future job and his followers scowled at these renegades but their mistress rewarded them with a gracious smile very well said she remarked thats the proper spirit do your duty by me and you will find me ready to do mine by you the day was hers as she felt when she returned in triumph to her dinner isaac sharpe happened to be strolling through the village that evening when he was accosted by mrs belbin who was standing as was her custom at this hour arms akimbo on her doorstep there be a great upset up at fianders baint there sir isaac brought his slow ruminative gaze to bear on her why what upset do ye mean mrs belbin things be like to be upset now that the master,0

he very moment he was supposed to appear the maids were up betimes and the business of the day progressed with far greater speed than usual at dinnertime she again observed a group of men in the yard smaller in number however than on the preceding day and talking with dismal countenances and hesitating tones susan came presently to announce as before that some of the men wished to speak to her rosalie went out and discovered a detachment of four awaiting her two with plaintive wobegone faces the others in a state of surly depression missus stammered james bundy we be acomeme and these here chapsbe acome to pologise and to say as we hopes ye wont bear no malice and as yell overlook what has passed well undertake to give satisfaction from this time forard t is a pity you did not say that yesterday james said rosalie severely bundy looked at cross and the latters jaw fell if yed please to overlook it mum resumed james falteringly we was so to speak,0

ever mind what mr sharpe said i have quite made up my mind as to what i shall do she was thoroughly in earnest and the men knew it they fell back ruefully and their young mistress returned to the house carrying her head very high and setting her face sternly when her work was over that afternoon she set out with a businesslike air on what seemed to be a tour of inspection first walking briskly along the rows of pigsties the condition of which had on the day before given rise to so much controversy all was now as it should be abel sam and one or two of the other subordinates having devoted their attention to them at early dawn here were pigs of every age and degree from the venerable matron to the spry young porker just beginning to devote himself to the serious business of lifenamely growing fat seventytwo in all and most of them doomed to destruction within a few months that was the part of the economy of farming which rosalie most disliked it was the blot on the otherwise po,0
etical and peaceful avocation but she had hitherto been taught to consider the presence of these pigs an absolute necessity was this really the case might not she with her womans wit devise some better expedient by means of which the obnoxious animals could be dispensed with and at the same time waste of skimmilk and whey avoided leaving the yard she betook herself to the orchard where a few more porcine families were taking exercise their presence somewhat detracted from the picturesque appearance of the place which though the blooth or blossom had long since fallen had still a considerable share of beauty of its own the sunlight beating down now through the delicate green leafage brought out wonderful silvery lights from the lichened trunks and outlined the curiously gnarled branches it struck out a golden path across the lush grass for rosalie to walk on and she passed slowly down the glade with bent head and serious face turning when she reached the end to retrace her steps,0
she saw a wellknown sturdy form approaching her and advanced to meet isaac sharpe still with a certain queenly air and without quickening her pace isaacs countenance on the contrary wore a perturbed and puzzled expression his brow was anxiously furrowed and he gazed hard at mrs fiander as he hastened towards her im afeared yeve had a deal o trouble here he began yes i followed your advice you see and it did nt altogether answer said the farmer with a nervous laugh oh yes it answered very well i think the men know im in earnest now them two hunts come round to my place at dinnertime they were in a taking poor chaps but twill do them good all the same i think id let em off if i was you mrs fiander job be a roughish sort o chap but he be a good cowman an abel he be wonderful with the management o pigs im not going to let them off said rosalie her face hardening again as she thought of abels maniacal dance and of the loud voice which h,0

l put no one in his place for i mean to sell the pigs sell the pigs ejaculated isaacat this time o year his face became absolutely tragic but rosalie merely nodded why whats to become o your skimmilk he gasped an the whey and that there will be no skimmilk said rosalie i shall make blue vinney cheese as i used to make when i was with my grandfather some people are very fond of it that is made entirely of skimmilk you know as for the whey there will not be much nourishment in it but i shall keep a few sows still just to consume that and the buttermilk they will not require much attention as they walk about here you see and there is always a lot of waste green stuff i dont think yell find many folks here what cares for the blue vinney cheese said isaac still much dejected nay t is all the haskim as they likes hereabouts the blue vinney has gone out o fashion so to speak if they dont buy them here i can send them to dorchester said,0
the widow resolutely they used to buy them up there faster than i could make them so you see there will be no waste mr sharpe there will be less work to do outside and therefore i shall not miss job or abel but as we shall be very busy in the dairy i must have two or three extra women to help me isaac stared at her ruefully she looked brighter than she had done since her husbands death but she also looked determined he shook his head slowly his mind was of the strictly conservative order and the contemplated abolition of pigs from the premises of this large dairyfarm seemed to him an almost sacrilegious innovation moreover to sell pigs in july to make cheeses that nobody in that part of the world cared to eat to replace two seasoned men who knew their businesswhatever might be their faultswith that dangerous commodity womankindthe whole experiment seemed to him utterly wild and pregnant with disaster i mean to do it said rosalie defying the condemnation in his face by,0
this time next year you will congratulate me on my success i hope so i am sure said isaac in a slightly offended tone i came here to advise ee but it seems ye dont want no advice oh yes i do she cried softening in a moment i value it of all things mr sharpe my one comfort in my difficulties is the thought that i can talk them over with you i have laid my plan before you quite simply in the hope that you would approve well my dear said isaac somewhat mollified i dont approve d ye see since you ask my advice ill tell ye plain that i dont think the plan will work ye wont be able to sell your pigs to begin with then yell want a man wi more experience than sam to look after the cows it baint such easy worknay that it baint then as to gettin more women bout the place i dont hold with the notion i dont think it ud benefit ye my dear i dont trewly rosalie appeared to meditate think it over mrs fiander he urged dont do nothing in a,0
hurry that be my advice thank you very much yes ill think it over youll come on sunday wont you mr sharpe ees agreed isaac doubtfully ees ill come on sunday i be main glad you be thinking of taking my advice mrs fiander i am grateful to you for giving it said rosalie with a sweet smile and the farmer walked away thinking that on the whole women were far less unreasonable than he had hitherto supposed the next day was thursdayearly closing day at branstontherefore no one was surprised when mrs fiander having as she averred some business to do in the town ordered the gig in the forenoon it was the first time she had used that vehicle since her husbands death and she looked sorrowful enough as she climbed into it clad in her deepest weeds the steady old horse looked round when she gathered up the reins as though wondering at the innovationfor elias had always been accustomed to driveand was with some difficulty induced to start nigger be so wise as a,0
christian that he be commented bundy as the gig and its occupant disappeared he was astandin and awaitin for master so sensible as i mid do myself but hell have to get used to the change the same as the rest of us ay an praps hell not like it so very well returned abel sardonically give a woman a whip in her hand and she fancies shes bound to lay it on but nigger was suffered to jog along the road at his own pace for the old sadness which had fallen upon rosalie had for a moment checked her eager spirit and a new preoccupation was moreover now added to it would elias approve of what she was about to do or would he agree with isaac no surely he would say that she knew best he was always pleased with anything she did he used to say that she was the best manager he had ever known and on the other hand used frequently to speak of isaacs notions with goodhumoured derision it will be seen that mrs fianders meditations over her friends advice had resulted as,0
indeed might have been expected in the determination to adhere to her original plan and she was now on her way to interview two personages whose cooperation would be necessary in carrying it out her appearance in the shop of mr hardy the principal grocer of the town caused a certain amount of commotion everybody turned to look at the beautiful young widow who had indeed for many days past formed the principal topic of conversation among the townsfolk and much interest was aroused by her murmured request to see mr hardy in private certainly mrs fiander step this way maam john open the door there john hardy a tall goodlooking young man in a white linen jacket hastened to obey his parents behest and was even good enough to accompany the visitor along the passage which led from the shop to the family sittingroom it was empty at this hour mrs hardy being presumably occupied in household duties and mr john ushered rosalie in with much ceremony and invited her to be seated i,0
n the best armchair some disappointment was perceptible in his ingenuous countenance when he found that the interview which had been so mysteriously asked for was merely connected with cheese but his father listened to rosalies proposition with grave attention i dont exactly see how the plan would work he remarked shaking his head we sell your haskim cheeses very fairly well mrs fiander mr hardy was a discreet person and was determined not to commit himself but as for the blue vinney id be very glad to oblige you but im really afraidyou see theres scarcely any demand for blue vinney nowadays a few of the old folks ask for it now and then but we dont get not to say a reglar custom for t and it would nt be worth our while to keep it i am considered a particularly good hand at making blue vinney said rosalie i used to be quite celebrated for it when i lived near dorchesterin fact i could easily sell my cheeses now at dorchester only i thought i would give you t,0
he first offer as you have dealt with me so long growing warm in her excitement she threw back her veil john hardy gazing at her flushed cheeks and sparkling eyes thought mrs fiander had never looked so handsome as in her widows weeds dorchester commented the senior that would be a long way for you to send maam i am sure put in the son quickly wed be sorry to think as mrs fiander should need to take her cheeses to dorchester father the elder mr hardy glanced from one to the other of the two young faces and as rosalie bestowed a grateful smile upon his son an idea seemed to strike him well he said goodnaturedly you are trying an experiment i understand mrs fiander theres always a certain amount o risk in an experiment but still nothing venture nothing have they say if youre willing to venture i shall be glad to help you all i can send your cheeses to me and ill do my best to sell em i wont promise to pay money down for em he added cautiou,0
sly same as i do for the haskims but ill try an sell em for you and we can settle about them after i am very much obliged said rosalie a little blankly however for she had not been accustomed to do business in this manner we will use our utmost endeavours to push the goodsof that you may be sure cried young john eagerly and she smiled upon him again so graciously that he somewhat lost his head and made several incoherent statements as to the excellence of blue vinney cheese for which his worthy father subsequently brought him to book thats not the way to get round a woman my lad he remarked mrs f will just think you be right down silly the notion o tellin her as blue vinney cheese was richer to the palate than rammilwhy rammils made altogether o good new milk and this heres nothin but skim she makes cheese o skim instead o givin it to the pigs and you go and tell her all that rubbish shes no foolthe widow is ntthat is nt the way to make up to her,0
meanwhile rosalie had driven across the marketplace and up a side street to the house of a certain auctioneer and to her great joy found him at home he was a stout middleaged man with some pretensions to good looks and more to being a dandy he was attired in a sporting costume of quite correct cut and received his visitor with an air of jovial hospitality delighted to see you im sure mrs fiander i feel honoured i am at your service for anything you may wishyou may command me maam rosalie had begun by expressing a desire to transact a little business with him and now proceeded to explain its nature i wish to sell my pigs by auction she said i have about sixtyfive to dispose of and i should like the sale to take place as early as possible next week next week ejaculated the auctioneer his face falling yes said rosalie with great decision buthave you considered the question it would be difficult to sell off such a number of pigs at any season of the year,0
but nowin the height of the summer if i may advise you mrs fiander dont be in such a hurry wait and sell the pigs at a more convenient time nobodys killing pigs now and most people as go in for fatting pigs have got as many as they want by this time it must be next week said the widow obstinately job and abel were leaving on the saturday and the stock must be got rid of before the new era began youll lose to a certainty maam said mr wilson running his hand through his welloiled hair what with all the regulations on account of the swine fever the selling of such a number of pigs would be a difficult matterat any season as i say and you dont give me no time scarcely to get out my bills the sale must take place before saturday week insisted rosalie you must do the best you can for me mr wilson you may rely on that mrs fiander but it really grieves me to think that you should lose so much he paused thoughtfully biting the end of one finger and suffe,0
ring his eyes meanwhile to travel slowly over the handsome face and graceful figure of his client during this scrutiny he was not unobservant of the rich materials of which her dress was composed and her general appearance of mournful prosperity well ill tell you what ill do he said its against my own interest but i always like to oblige a ladyparticularly such a lady as you mrs fiander ill drive round the country and see if i can persuade people to buy up those pigs by private contract i know a pigjobber over shaftesbury side as might be glad to take a good many off you if he got them at a low price if i understand you mrs fiander the price is not an object to you noo faltered rosalie of course i should like as much money as possible for them but the price is not so important as to get rid of the animals as soon as possible just so agreed the auctioneer cheerfully well mrs fiander i shall lose by it as i say but i will try and arrange matters for you in,0
this way under the circumstances maam i grudge no time or trouble spent in your service i am always thought to be a ladys manmy late poor wife used to say that my consideration for ladies injured the business but as i used to tell her a man has a heart or else he has nt if he has a heartif he has more feelings than his neighbours he is nt to blame for it let the business go my dear i d say but dont ask me to be hard on a woman it had been whispered among the gossips of branston that during the lifetime of the late mrs wilson her lord had been wont to correct her occasionally with a bootjack but these rumours had not reached rosalies ears and even if they had she would probably have disbelieved them nevertheless she did not quite like the manner in which the gallant auctioneer leered at her nor his unnecessarily warm pressure of her hand on saying goodbye she drove homewards with a mixture of feelings the inauguration of her new plan seemed to involve a consider,0

the three there was comfort in this thought and rosalie looked gratefully at her visitor whose eyes had again become suffused with tears as he recalled this touching tribute he used to say she observed presently in a low voice that i was a very good manager but i dont think it was on that account alone he was so fond of me ees he did use to say you was a wonderful manager said isaac disregarding the latter part of the sentence many a time heve atold me that you had nt got no equal as a manager sentiment was evidently not to be the order of the day but here at least was an opportunity of introducing the little matter of business which weighed so heavily on rosalies conscience i think she said diffidently he would say i was wise in carrying out this new plan what new plan inquired isaac pausing with his handkerchief halfway to his eyes and turning towards her sternly though the tears hung upon his grizzled lashes why the one i spoke to you ofabout doing,0
away with the pigs you know she returned faintly that there notion that i gie ye my advice agen said sharpe grimly yes hesitatingly i thought it over as you told me to and i did nt think i could manage differently i find i can sell the pigs all right and mr hardy has promised to try and dispose of my blue vinney cheeses isaac blew his nose returned his handkerchief to his pocket and stood up im glad to hear as ye can manage so well he said sarcastically you dont want no advice thats plain and i shant never offer you none agen ill wish ye good day mrs fiander oh dont go away like that cried she piteously please dont be offended with me such an old friend at this moment a figure passed across the window and a loud knock was heard at the housedoor rosalie rushed to the door of the parlour dont let any one in susan she cried say imim engaged stay at least a minute mr sharpei want to tell youi want to explain throwing out,0
one hand in pleading she held open the parlour door an inch or two with the other and presently the manly tones of mr cross were heard through the chink i am sorry to hear that mrs fiander is engaged will you kindly inform her that i will call next sunday tell him susan said her mistress opening the door a little way and speaking under her breathtell him that i am always engaged on sunday susan was heard to impart this information and then the visitors tones were heard again thats a pity tell her if you please that i shall ope to have the pleasure of finding her at home some afternoon during the week i am always out in the afternoon said rosalie speaking this time so decidedly that it was not necessary for susan to repeat her words oh said the young man addressing this time not the maid but the bright eye of which he caught a glimpse through the door then i shall take my chance of finding you in the morning i am too busy to see anyone in the morning retor,0
ted rosalie and she shut the door with a finality which left mr cross no option but to depart you see i do take your advice sometimes said rosalie turning to isaac and speaking in a plaintive tone though a little smile played about her mouth isaacs back was towards her and he made no reply as she approached the burly form however she saw his shoulders heave and presently to her great relief discovered that he was shaking with silent laughter well my dear ye dont do things by halvesill say that for ee he chuckled youve agot rid o that there chap anyhow hell not ax to come coortin again well well if ye manage as well in other ways ill not say that ye baint fit to look arter yourself but it was your advice you know mr sharpe she said demurely you gave me the hint about shutting the door i d low i did said isaac and being a goodnatured and placable person his transitory sense of resentment was soon replaced by thorough appreciation of the humo,0
rous side of the situation the discomfiture of samuel cross gave a salutary lesson not only to himself but to sundry other adventurous young men who had been a little hasty in their overtures to mrs fiander it was soon noised abroad that the young widow wished for the present to keep herself to herself as the saying went and that it would in consequence be advisable to abstain from making advances to herat least until she had laid aside her crape for some months therefore rosalie enjoyed comparative immunity from the importunities which had so much annoyed her while the new arrangements appeared to work amazingly well both within and without littlecomb farm job and abel departed in due course the pigs were soldat considerable loss to their owner sam was installed as chief cowman and sustained his honours cheerfully without however appearing to be unduly elated and three strapping damsels were engaged as dairymaids with their cooperation mrs fiander turned out weekly a score and m,0
ore of large round cheeses which were stowed away in an upper room until in course of time they should become sufficiently ripesome people might use the term mouldyto have earned their title of blue vinney cheese this process took a considerable time and meanwhile the profits of the dairy were a good deal lessened since rosalie had left off making the haskim cheeses for which she had been so particularly famed and for which she had invariably received regular payment still as she told herself when the blue vinneys were disposed of she would receive her money in a lump sum and all would be the same in the end her chief trouble at this time arose from the frequent calls of mr wilson the auctioneer who though he could not be said to be regularly paying attention to rosalie found nevertheless sundry excuses for dropping in and conversing with her at all manner of unseasonable times he made as has been implied no direct advances and rosalie moreover could not treat him so uncer,0
emoniously as she had treated mr cross for she felt in a manner indebted to him about the sale of those unlucky pigs he had carried the matter through for her with great difficulty to himself as he frequently assured her and he had steadily refused all remuneration it was hard therefore for the young widow to repel or avoid him and she was in consequence reluctantly obliged to endure many hours of his society chapter viii your own fair youth you care so little for it smiling towards heaven you would not stay the advances of time and change upon your happiest fancies i keep your golden hour and will restore it alice meynell one september day rosalie betook herself to the little churchyard where elias lay at rest three months had elapsed since he had been taken from her and she had not let a week pass without visiting and decorating his grave she thought of him often and her affectionate regret was in no,0
way diminished yet though she was now on her way to perform this somewhat melancholy duty she advanced with a bright face and a rapid bounding step she was young full of vigour and elasticity and on such a day as thisan exquisite golden day full of sunshine and yet with a tartness hinting of approaching autumn in the airevery fibre of her being thrilled with the very joy of life when she knelt by her husbands grave however her face became pensive and her movements slow taking a pair of garden shears from the basket which she carried she clipped the short grass closer still laid the flowers gently down on the smooth surface placed the dead ones in her basket and after lingering a moment bent forward and kissed the new white headstone as she rose and turned to go away her face still shadowed by tender regret she suddenly perceived that she was not alone at a little distance from her ensconced within the angle of the churchyard wall a man was sitting with an easel in front of him,0
above the large board on the easel she caught sight of a brown velveteen coat and a flannel shirt loosely fastened with a brilliant tie also of a dark face framed in rather long black hair and shaded by a soft felt hat of peculiar shape from beneath its tilted brim however a pair of keen dark eyes were gazing with intense curiosity at the young woman and though he held a palette in one hand and a brush in the other he was evidently more interested in her than in his painting rosalie vexed that her recent display of feeling had been observed by this stranger walked quickly down the little path colouring high with displeasure the while and assuming that stately carriage which came naturally to her in such emergencies the gentleman turned slowly on his campstool his eyes twinkling and his dark moustache twitching and watched her till she was out of sight rosalie was clad in her morning print and wore her widebrimmed chip hat so that her attire gave no indication of her station in life,0
as her tall figure disappeared the man rose stepped past his easelwhich supported a canvas whereon already appeared in bold firm lines a sketch of the antiquated church porchand made his way up the path and across the grass to elias fianders grave let us see he murmured that kiss spoke volumes it must be a sweetheart at the very least yet when she came swinging down the meadowpath she certainly looked heartwhole here we area brandnew stone funny nameelias fiander noaged sixtytwo must have been her father or perhaps her grandfatherthe girl looked young enoughso all my pretty romance has come to nothing i wish she had stayed a few minutes longeri would give something to make a sketch of her he went back to his work whistling and thinking over rosalies beautiful face and figure regretfully and with an admiration that was entirely sthetic for he had a cheery rotund little wife at home in london and half a dozen children to provide for so that he was not given to sent,0
iment it was perhaps because his admiration was so innocent and his ambition so laudable that a few days later his wish to transfer rosalies charms to canvas was granted in a most unexpected way it had been unusually hot and the artist having finished his sketch of the porch was proceeding by a short cut through littlecomb farm to the downs beyond in search of cooler air when on crossing a cornfield at the further end of which the reapers were busily at work he suddenly came upon a womans figure lying in the shade of a shock of sheaves the first glance announced her identity the second assured him that she was fast asleep she had removed her hat and her clasped hands supported her head the upward curve of the beautiful arms being absolutely fascinating to the artists eye the oval face with its warm colouring the slightly loosened masses of dark hair were thrown into strong relief by the golden background the absolute abandonment of the whole form was so perfect in its grace that,0
he paused trembling with artistic delight and hardly daring to breathe lest he should disturb her but rosalie overcome with the heat and tired out after a hard mornings work slept peacefully on while he swung his satchel round opened it quickly and began with swift deft fingers to make a rapid sketch of her a few light pencil strokes suggested the exquisite lines of the prostrate form and he had already begun to dash on the colour when with a loud shriek and flapping of wings a blackbird flew out of the neighbouring hedge and rosalie stirred and opened her eyes rosalies eyes always took people by surprise and the artist who had not before noticed their colour suffered his to rest upon them appreciatively while they were still hazy with sleep but when with returning consciousness he observed a sudden wonder and indignation leap into them he threw out his hand hastily one moment if you pleasestay just as you are for one moment still under the influence of her recent heavy slumb,0
er and taken aback by the peremptory tone rosalie obeyed what are you doing she inquired suspiciously but without changing her posture dont you see he returned i am making a picture of you a warm tide of colour spread over the upturned face you should nt do that without asking my leave a man must take his chances where he finds them said the artist i dont often get such a chance as this i am a poor man and cant afford to let an opportunity slip he had a shrewd sallow face and kind merry eyes and as he spoke he paused in his work and smiled down at her i dont want to be disobliging said rosalie but ii dont like it i fell asleep by accidenti should nt have thrown myself down like this if i had thought anyone was likely to see me all the better commented he you could nt have put yourself into such a position if you had tried to it has evidently come naturally and it is simply perfect he paused to squeeze out a little colour from one of the ti,0
ny tubes in his open box and again smiled encouragingly down at his model now will you oblige me by closing your eyes again no dont screw them up like that let the lids drop gentlyso very good t is a pity to hide the eyesone does not often see blue eyes with such murillo colouring but the length of the lashes makes amends and i want you asleep again a wave of colour swept over rosalies face the stranger marked it approvingly and worked on is it nearly done she inquired presently you said you would only be a moment i find it will take several moments but i am sure you would not grudge me the time if you knew what a wonderful piece of good fortune this is for me how can it be good fortune for you dont frown please let the lids lie loosely i will tell you why i consider this meeting a piece of good fortune do you know what it is to make breadandbutter i make butter three times a week returned rosalie somewhat amused and i make bread too sometimes,0
well i have got to make breadandbutter every day of my life not only for myself but for my wife and six small children and i have nothing to make it with but this you may open your eyes for a moment if you dont move otherwise rosalie opened her eyes and saw that he was bending towards her and holding out a paintbrush now go to sleep again he went on yes thats what i make my breadandbutter with and it is nt always an easy task because there are a great many other chaps who want to make breadandbutter in the same kind of way and we can never be quite sure which among the lot of us will find the best market for his wares but i shall have no difficulty in disposing of you i am certaintherefore i consider myself in luck do you mean that you will sell that little picture of me not this one but a big one which i shall make from it it will go to an exhibition and people will come and look at it as the subject is quite new and very pretty i shall ask a big price f,0
or it and there will be lots of breadandbutter for a long time to come but would anybody care to buy a picture of a woman whom they dont know lying asleep in a cornfield cried rosalie incredulously and involuntarily raising her drooped lids most certainly they will responded the artist confidently this will be a lovely thing when it is done i shall come here tomorrow and make a careful study of this stook against which you are lying and of the field and i shall look about for a few good types of harvesters to put in the middle distance he was speaking more to himself than to her but rosalie listened with deep interest and watched him sharply through her halfclosed lids suddenly she saw him laugh perhaps if i come across a very attractive specimen of a rustic i may place him just behind the stook here peering through the sheaves at you or bending forward as if he were going to oh dont cried rosalie starting violently and opening her eyes wide no i wont have i,0
t i wont be in the picture at all if you put anything of that kind in notif i chose a particularly nice young man inquired the painter still laughing softly to himself not if i chosethe young man i am sure i dont know what you mean protested she her cheeks crimson again and her lips quivering there is no young man do you mean to tell me my dear child that with that face you have lived till now without anyone courting youas i suppose they would call it oh of course they court me rosalie hastened to admit but i hate them all and they are all very ugly she added eagerly and would look dreadful in a picture there you are frowning again come let us talk of something less exciting keep still please so you make butter three times a week do you you are a farmers daughter i suppose i was a farmers granddaughter she returned my father was a schoolmaster ah that accounts for your educated way of speaking no father died when i was quit,0
e a baby but my grandfather sent me to school then you live with your mother i suppose no i live alone here this farm belongs to me she could not help peeping out beneath her lashes to judge of the effect of her words and was gratified when the busy brush paused and the dark eyes glanced down at her in astonishment you live alone here but this is a big farmyou cant manage it all yourself yes i do it is hard work but i contrive to do it i am rather lonely though that will be remedied in time said the artist encouragingly the right man will come along and perhaps he added with that queer smile of his you wont find him so ugly as the rest you dont know who i am or you would nt speak like that said rosalie with dignity adding with a softer inflexion of her voice the right man has comeand gone i am a widow and unclasping the hands beneath her head she thrust forward the left one with the shining weddingring confusion and concern now replaced t,0

nt on with his work perhaps i shall call this picture the sleeping beauty he observed after a pause with apparent irrelevance you know the story dont you yes but i dont think it would be a good name she was a princess who went to sleep in a palace in the wood and i am just iin my working dress asleep in a cornfield these are mere details said he the main points of the story are the same she woke up all right you know you will wake up some day too my beauty he put such meaning into the words and smiled down at her so oddly that she felt confused and uncomfortable it was not that her pride was wounded at the liberty he had taken in applying such a term to her his admiration was so evidently impersonal that it could not offend her and moreover his allusion to his wife and children had had a tranquillising effect but the mans look and tone when he made this strange remark filled her with vague disquietude both betrayed a secret amusement mingled with somethin,0
g like compassion she would wake up some day he said but she did not want to wake up she was quite happyat least as happy as could be in her bereaved stateshe asked nothing more from life it would be certainly more unpleasant than the reverse to discover that life had surprises in store for her but why need she trouble herself about a prophecy so idly uttered and by an absolute stranger nevertheless she did trouble herself not only throughout the remainder of the time that the artist was completing his sketch but frequently afterwards you will wake up some day my beauty oh no no let her sleep on if this placid contented existence were indeed sleep let her dream away the days in peace until that time of awakening which would reunite her to elias chapter ix then proud celinda hope no more to be implord or wood since by thy scorn thou dost restore the wealth my love bestowd and thy disdain too late shall find that none are fair but who are kind,0
thomas stanley when the artist had gone away after lingering some days longer to complete his studies for the projected picture the tenor of rosalies existence flowed on as calmly as even she could desire she made and sold her butter had her cheeses conveyed to mr hardys establishment in branston superintended the harvesting of her potatoes and mangels laid in her winter store of oilcake and fattened sundry turkeys and geese for the christmas market early on a winters afternoon rosalie fiander might have been seen walking slowly across the downs in the neighbourhood of isaac sharpes farm she carried a large basket and every now and then paused to add to the store of scarlet berries or shining evergreen which she was culling from thicket and hedgerow for christmas decoration all at once she was surprised by hearing a step on the path behind her and a mans voice calling her name and turning descried the tall and somewhat ung,0

ead but over rosalies leering the while in a manner which materially increased her discomposure all at once she saw that a sprig of mistletoe was tucked into the band of mr burges headgear and almost at the moment she made this discovery he lurched forward so as to bar her progress and bent his face towards hers how dare you cried rosalie thrusting him from her with a vigorous push then as he momentarily lost his equilibrium and staggered backwards against the hedge she fairly took to her heels and fled from him at full speed not towards her own home but to isaac sharpes premises o mr sharpe she cried breathlessly oh oh save me hes after me whos arter you my dear why you be ashakin same as an aspentree what in the name o goodness has put you in such a state oh itsits that dreadful andrew burge he overtook me on the downs and tried to kiss me i think hes tipsy and i know hes running after me nay now my dear dont ee take on so hell not,0

nly waited for an opportunity of proving his goodwill by ridding her of a frequent and unwelcome visitor his chance came at last and he was quick to take advantage of it it was cheeseday and rosalie and her maids had prepared such a quantity that their work was not as usual finished before dinnertime and they were still elbowdeep in curds when mr wilson chanced to look in sam was standing in the outer room swilling out the great cheesevat which had held that morning a hundred and eighty gallons of skimmilk a wonderfully obliging fellow was sam always ready to lend a hand here to do an odd job there and so goodtempered with it all his mistress could often see his smiling mouth open and ready to agree with whatever remark he thought her likely to make long before she had spoken and as she liked contradiction as little as any of her sex her headman advanced the more rapidly in her favour she was anything but gratified when mr wilson appeared on the threshold of the milkhouse and,0
after a brief greeting bent her head over her mould and went on with her work always busy mrs fiander remarked the visitor pleasantly pon my word you ladies put us to shame sometimes we men are idle creatures in comparison with you rosalie made no answer and sam banged about the vat with his stiff brush so energetically that he seemed bent on giving the lie to the auctioneers words i am really quite curious to see how you set about your cheesemaking pursued the latter in mellifluous tones should i be in your way mrs fiander if i was to step in and watch you i am afraid you would nt find it very amusing responded rosalie unwillingly of course if you like but it will really be most uncomfortable for you we are all in such a mess here samirritablywhat a din you do make with that tub sam who had tilted up the tub the better apparently to scrub the bottom now let it go suddenly sending a great portion of its contents splashing across the floor in mr wilson,0
s direction it be all the same he remarked philosophically i were just agoin to swill out this here place and with that he upset a little more of the steaming water upon the floor seized a stiff broom and began to brush the soapy liquid towards the door you might have waited a moment commented his mistress but she spoke with a sweet smile for she saw with the corner of her eye how hastily mr wilson had skipped out of the way anxious to protect his shining boots and immaculate leggings i really cannot invite you in now she added turning to the visitor regretfully pray excuse the mans awkwardness but as she spoke she smiled again on sam she related the anecdote with much gusto to isaac sharpe on the following sunday but he did not seem to appreciate it as much as she had expected that there wilson hes arter you too i suppose i would nt have anything to say to him if i was you he baint steady enough to make a good husbandracin an drinkin and sichlike ah,0
his poor wife she did nt praise him but she suffered poor soul gracious mr sharpe i am sure you need nt warn me you know what my views are besides i hate the man i would nt see him at all if he had nthad nt been rather obliging in a businessway but was nt it clever of sam to get rid of him like that ees agreed the farmer dubiously but dont ee go for to let en take too much on hisself my dear else yell be like to repent it it do never do to let these young fellows get sot up keep en in his place mrs fiander dont let en get presumptious im sure he would never be that she rejoined warmly poor sam hes the humblest creature in the world he goes about his work likelike a machine may be so said isaac incredulously you know him best i suppose but i jist thought id speak my mind out about him rosalie frowned a little and said no more but her faith in sam was not diminished and as time went on she grew to rely more and more on this chee,0
rful and obliging young fellow the gossiping anent the alleged courting of mrs fiander by farmer sharpe was not confined to littlecomb village but soon spread to the more important town of branston with the immediate result of stirring up sundry of the young men belonging to that place who after the discomfiture of samuel cross had deemed it prudent to relax for a time in their attentions to the fascinating widow so long as she had been thought plunged in grief these wooers of hers had been content to bide their time but when it became known that there was actually an avowed suitor in the field and one moreover to whom the lady had given unequivocal tokens of confidence and goodwill they resolved with one accord to bestir themselves lest the prize of which each thought himself most deserving might be secured by another before many days of the new year had passed rosalie found herself absolutely besieged samuel cross actually forced his way past the unwilling susan into the parlour while,0
rosalie was at tea mr wilson lay in wait for her as she was emerging from church on christmas day and made his proposal in due form as he escorted her homewards john hardy inveigled the widow into the back parlour behind the shop ostensibly to discuss the sale of the blue vinneys in reality to lay his hand and heart at her feet rosalie said no to one and all and was astonished at the outburst of indignation which her answer provoked and at the keen sense of illusage under which every one of her suitors appeared to be labouring it was samuel cross who first alluded in rosalies hearing to the prevalent belief that farmer sharpe was paying his court to her and he was somewhat taken aback by the unfeigned merriment which the suggestion evoked you may laugh mrs fiander he said recovering himself after an instant but people are not blind and deaf and though they may be fooled to a certain extent by a lady gentlemen of my profession find it easy to put two and two together maam wh,0
en a lady tells you she is always engaged on a sunday and shuts the door in the face of a person who comes to make civil inquiries one does nt need to be extra clever to guess that there must be some reason for it and when the reason turns out to be another gentleman and when that gentleman takes upon himself to assault another gentleman as was also desirous of paying his respects in the same quarter that mrs fiander is what one may term primfacie evidence whether the display of mr crosss learning had a sobering effect on mrs fiander or whether she was suddenly struck by some serious thought it is certain that she ceased laughing at this juncture and remained pensive even after the rejected suitor had departed mr wilson was harder to get rid of he was so confident in the justice of his claim so pertinacious in reminding rosalie of her obligations towards him with regard to the sales of the pigswhich piece of business he perseveringly alluded to as a delicate matterso persuaded,0
moreover of his own superiority to any of her other lovers that she finally lost patience and petulantly declared that if there were not another man in the world she would not consent to marry him the auctioneer grew purple in the face and suddenly changed his note if there was nt another man in the world he repeated sneeringly then there is another man ha it is nt very hard to guess who well tastes differ if you like such a rough common old chap better than a gentleman doing a large and honourable business i make you a present of him mrs fiander smockfrock and all ha ha hell soon have the pigs back again when hes master here and all my labour and loss of time will have been thrown away not that i grudge the sacrifice cried mr wilson in a melting tone no far be it from me to grudge the sacrifice the ladies have always found an easy prey in me and when i think of the far greater sacrifice which a young and lovely woman is prepared to make upon the altar of matr,0
imonya sacrifice which she will repent too latei am rejooced to silence here mr wilson thumped his breast and cast a last languishing look at the young widow who appeared however to be absorbed in her own reflections he talked on in spite of his last assertion until they reached rosalies door where waking as if from a dream she extended her hand to him goodbye she said there is no use in talking about it any more mr wilson my mind is made up the auctioneer extended his hand dramatically in the direction of the empty pigsties well mrs fiander he cried if the inspector of nuisances visits your premises you will only have yourself to thank meanwhile retorted rosalie with some acerbity as it might be a little difficult to send for him today i should be glad if the nuisance who is now occupying my premises would take himself off she went into the house with a flushed face but seemed more thoughtful than annoyed during the remainder of the day it was however,0
with unmixed vexation that she perused on the morning following her rejection of young john hardy a document signed by the firm which ran thus to mrs fiander madamre blue vinney cheeseswe regret to inform you that we can no longer allow our premises to be used as a storehouse for these unsaleable articles in the three months during which in order to oblige you we have placed our establishment at your disposal we have only found one purchaser for a small portion of the goods in question as you will see per statement copied from our books and enclosed herewith under these circumstances we are returning to you today as many of the cheeses as the carriers cart can convey and we shall be obliged by your removing the remainder at your earliest convenience we are madam yours obediently hardy son the enclosed statement testified to t,0

out having even disposed of oneto be turned into a laughingstock for her own folks as well as for the whole town of branston to be actually made to pay for the illsuccess of her experiment rosalie was as a rule openhanded and generous enough but the disbursal of this particular sixteenandeightpence caused her a pang of almost physical anguish half an hour later when the carrier had departed and the men returned to their work she entered the dairy and stood gazing with clasped hands and a melancholy countenance at the heaps of despised blue vinneys which were piled up on every side to her presently came sam belbin his arms dangling limply by his sides his expression duly composed to sympathetic gloom oh sam exclaimed rosalie in a heartbroken tone pointing tragically to the nearest yellow mound i would nt take on im sure mum responded sam with a ghastly smile nay now i would nt take on t was very ill done o mr hardyso everybody do say but hes that graspinhe never,0

abraham cowley isaac sharpe receiving no answer to his knock walked straight into the parlour the room was dark save for the smouldering glow of the fire and it was some time before he discovered rosalies figure huddled up in eliass chair why what be to do he inquired stooping over her oh mr sharpe returned she with a strangled sob i have had such a dayi have been so insulted oh how shall i ever forget it what can i have done to bring about such a thing come cried the farmer much alarmed whatever is it my dear out wi it and lets have some light to see ourselves by with that he seized the poker and stirred the logs on the hearth until they flared up with a brightness almost painful to rosalies aching eyes he saw the traces of tears upon her flushed face and his concern increased i heard ye was in trouble again he said and i thought id look inthem cheeses as yeve been amaking of ever since midsum,0
mer is back on your hands they tell me yes said rosalie faintly there are piles and piles of them in the dairy and mr hardy wrote a most illnatured letter about them and everyone in the place will think me a fool but it is nt that i mind so muchi shall sell those cheeses somewhere i suppose and i know mr hardy only sent them back out of spite because i would nt marry john ah put in isaac interested john hardy axed ye did he and you would nt have en of course not she returned petulantly well mrs f said isaac leaning forward in his chair and speaking solemnly ye mid ha done worse nor take him t is in my mind he went on emphatically as soon or late yell have to take a second but tell me what was it as upset ye so much today i am almost ashamed to say it sam belbinyou know sam that common lad that i made cowman out of pure kindness and because i thought him faithfulhehethat lout has actually dared to make love to me well now co,0

behind him rosalie sprang to her feet and began to pace hastily about the room what had she done she had actually in so many words made an offer of marriage to isaac sharpeand she was not quite sure of being accepted there was the rub elias was an old man yet he had wooed her in her homeless penniless condition with a certain amount of ardour in her widowhood she had been courted doubtless as much on account of her wealth as of her beauty but certainly with no lack of eagerness and now when she had turned with affectionate confidence to this old friend and practically laid herself her good looks and good fortune at his feet he had promised unwillingly to think it over it was not to be enduredshe would send him to the rightabout on his return let his decision be what it might but then came the sickening remembrance of the failures and humiliations which had attended her unassisted enterprises the importunities of distasteful suitorsworst of all the confident leer on sam belbi,0

ll ride on to the village he said and make arrangements about leaving your horse there and getting a fresh one it will save time and there is none to spare if you want to get home before dusk he raised his cap mounted and disappeared before rosalie had time to protest indeed she was glad enough of richard marshalls helpful company when she presently arrived at the black horse inn where in spite of the framed poetical effusion which hung beneath the sign and which testified to the merits of the establishment there was some difficulty in procuring accommodation and attention for poor nigger and even greater in finding a substitute in fact the only animal available proved to be a huge rawboned threeyearold who was with great difficulty persuaded to enter the shafts of the gig and who when harnessed tilted up the vehicle in such a peculiar manner that rosalie shrank back in alarm he does nt look safe she faltered and im quite sure that boy is nt capable of driving him i h,0
ave been shaken by the fright i suppose for i feel quite unnerved i will drive you said richard with decision waving aside the lad who had been appointed charioteer and who now began to assert his perfect competence to perform the task i guess i can manage most things in the way of horseflesh and in any case i intended to go to my uncles tomorrow oh no i could nt think rosalie was beginning when he interrupted her eagerly nothing will be easier i assure you my bag is here strapped on to my bicycle i meant to take my uncle by surprisehe does nt know i am in england you can send back the horse tomorroweven if you took the lad it would be difficult for him to return tonight my bicycle can stay here until i send for it or fetch it perhaps i had better get in first mrs fiander to keep this wild animal quiet while you get up hand over the reins herethats it hold on by his head till the lady mounts put that machine of mine in a dry place will you now then mr,0
s fiander give me your hand whoa boy steady there we arelet go he laid the whip lightly on the animals back and they were off before rosalie had had time to protest or to demur the long legs of the threeyearold covered the ground in a marvellous manner and with that tall masterful figure by her side she could feel no fear indeed the sensation of swinging along through the brisk air was pleasant enough though she felt a little uncomfortable at the thought of the astonishment which her arrival in such company would produce at home and she was moreover not quite certain if she relished being thus peremptorily taken possession of by the newcomer rosalie was used to think and act for herself and it was quite a new experience to her to have her will gainsaid and her objections overborne even in her own interests but after all the man was isaacs nephew and no one could find fault with her for accepting his assistance in a few months time she would be his auntperhaps he would t,0
hen allow her wishes to have more weight she smiled to herself as she glanced up at himwhat would he say if she told him the relationship which he would shortly bear to her he would be her nephew how ridiculous it seemed he must be some years older than she was there were firm lines in that brown face and the hands looked capable and strong as if they had accomplished plenty of work when they reached yellowham hill once more and began to descend at a foots pace richard broke silence i have seen and done a good many things in the course of my travels but i have never come across so beautiful a spot as this and none of my adventures have been so curious as the one which introduced me to you really said rosalie drily i cannot see that there was anything so very extraordinary in it even if nigger had not had this accident we should have been certain to meet while you are staying at mr sharpes i wonder said the young man speaking half to himself and half to heri wonder if,0
i should have preferred to meet you first in your own fieldsin a cornfield but the corn of course will not be ripe for months to come no on the whole i am content i said to myself when i was climbing the hill there is magic in this place and i felt it was home i dont know what you mean said rosalie what can it matter where one first meets a new acquaintance and why should it be in a cornfield i saw you first in a cornfield said he but surely you were not in england last harvest time she cried what are you talking about you have only just said that you would like to have met me first in a cornfield which proveswhat is truethat you have never seen me before i have seen you before he murmured in a low voice nonsense nonsense she cried sharply you must have dreamt it yesi did dreamabout you he owned glancing at her and once more that curious look of wondering joy stole over his face rosalie drew a little away from him in a displeasure which h,0
e was quick to observe i will explain some day he said looking down at her with a smile which disarmed her and then having reached the bottom of the hill he chirruped to the horse and they sped along once more at an exhilarating pace byandby he began to talk about his uncle speaking of him with such evident affection that the heart of the future mrs sharpe warmed to him her grateful regard for isaac had increased during their four months betrothal indeed it could not have been otherwise he was so placid and goodnatured and obliging moreover he took a lot of trouble off her hands for he had assumed the management of the farm immediately after their engagement no one could cavil at this arrangement it was natural that the man who was so shortly to be master should at once take over the control of affairs even the gossips of the neighbourhood could make no illnatured comments one and all indeed agreeing that it was pretty behaviour on the part of the widow fiander to postpon,0
e the wedding till after the year was out so rosalie listened well pleased while richard spoke of isaacs past generosity to him and his mother of the high esteem in which he held him and of his desire to spend a few weeks in his company before going out into the world afresh perhaps i ought to tell him that i am going to marry his uncle thought rosalie and then she dismissed the notion let isaac make the announcement himself she felt rather shy about itand possibly richard marshall might not like the idea she began to question him instead anent his past achievements and future prospects and heard with astonishment and concern that the young man had not only failed to make his fortune in the distant lands he had visited but had come back in some ways poorer than he had set out only in some things though he said i reckon i am richer on the whole how are you poorer and how are you richer queried rosalie i am poorer in pocket my uncle sent me out with a nice little sum to,0
start me in life ah as i tell you hes a firstrate old chap he could nt have done more for me if i had been his son well thats gone long ago but i have come back richer all the samerich in experience for one thing i have seen a lot and learnt a lot i educated myself out there in more ways than one dear old dorset holds a very fine place on the map of england yet t is but a tiny corner of the world after all as she listened there came to rosalie a sudden inexplicable envy she had never been out of her native countyshe had never wanted to travel beyond its borders but for a moment the thought struck her that it might be a fine and desirable thing to see the world i wonder she said tartly for her irritation at this discovery recoiled on its unsuspicious causei wonder mr marshall you should care to come back to dorset since you have such a poor opinion of it why did nt you settle out there out where he inquired with a smile i have tried to settle in a good many,0
places i was in a newspaper office in new yorkit was while i was there that i did most in the way of educating myselfand then i went to san francisco and then to texas ive been pretty well over the states in fact and ive been to mexico and brazil and canada i might have done well in several places if i could have made up my mind to stick to the job in handbut i could nt something was drawing me all the timedrawing me back to englanddrawing me home so that at last i felt i must come back and what will you do now she inquired with curiosity oh he cried drawing a deep breath i must work on a farm the love for farmwork is in my blood i believe i want the smell of the freshturned earth i want my arms to be tired heaving the sheaves into the waggons i want to lead out the horses early in the morning into the dewy fieldsi want oh many things rosalie considered him wonderingly these things were done around her every day as a matter of course but how curiously the ma,0
n spoke of them how unaccountable was that longing of which he spoke she had never seen anyone the least like him and now that the conversation had drifted away from herself she felt a real pleasure and interest in listening to his talk as they drove onward through the gathering twilight she too was moved to talk and was charmed by his quick understanding and ready response her own wits were quick enough but she had fallen into the habit of keeping her opinions on abstract subjects to herself the concrete was all that the people with whom she associated were capable of discussing and indeed they had not much to say on any matter at any time this young bright personality was something so absolutely new to her his point of view so original and vigorous and his sympathy so magnetic that rosalie enjoyed her adventure as she had never enjoyed anything in her life before her eyes shone her cheeks flushed her merry laugh rang out she felt that she too was young and lighthearted and th,0
at life and youth and gay companionship made a very delightful combination as they drew near their destination a sudden silence fell between them and presently richard broke it speaking in a soft and altered tone how familiar the country grows even in the dark i recognise a friend at every turn is not that your house yonder where the lights are glimmering yes said rosalie with a little unconscious sigh the cornfield where i saw you lies just to the right of it i wish you would not talk in riddles said rosalie breathing rather quickly through the dusk he could see the wrathful fire in her eyes do not be angry he said quickly i meant to tell you another time when i had come to know you better but after all why should i not tell you now i saw a picture of you in london i stayed a day or two there on my way through from liverpooli had some business to do for a friend in new yorkand i went to the academy and there in the very first room i saw your picture my pictu,0
re ejaculated she it must have been the one that london gentleman said he would paint yes it was youyou yourself and you were lying in a cornfield under a shock of wheat and the corner of your house could just be seen in the distance and some of the men were reaping a little way offbut you were fast asleep rosalies heart was thumping in a most unusual way and her breath came so pantingly that she did not trust herself to speak t was a big picture he said full of sunshine and when i saw itthe whole thingthe great field stretching away and the men working and the quiet old house in the distance and the girl sleeping so placidlyit was all so glowing and yet so peaceful and homelike that my heart went out to it thats dorset i said and i believe i criedi know i felt as if i could cry after all those years of wandering to find when i thought myself all alone in a great strange city that piece of home smiling at onei tell you it made one feel queer rosalie remained,0
silent angry with herself for the agitation which had taken possession of her so you see i was not quite so far wrong in saying that todays meeting was a very strange one the first instant my eyes fell upon you i recognised you she felt she must say something but her voice sounded husky and quite unlike itself when she spoke it certainly was odd that we should come across each other near dorchester it would of course have been quite natural if you had recognised me when you came to your uncles i thought you would have been more interested in my story he said reproachfully after a pause i ami am very much interested i think it a very funny story funny he repeated and then relapsed into silence which remained unbroken until they turned in at rosalies gate chapter ii a thousand thorns and briers and stings i have in my poor breast yet neer can see that salve which brings my passion any rest,0
herrick well my boy i be main glad you be come back there baint no place like home be there as isaac sharpe repeated these words for the twentieth time since his nephews arrival he beamed affectionately upon him through the fragrant steam of the bowl of punch specially brewed in his honour and then leaning back in his chair sighed and shook his head ye be wonderful like your mother richard he said and sighed again and groaned and took another sip of punch blinking the while partly from the strength of the decoction and partly because he was overcome by emotion richard sitting opposite to him stretched out his legs luxuriously to the warmth of the crackling wood fire and removing his pipe from his lips gazed contentedly round the familiar kitchen which was now looking its best in the homely radiance it is good to come back to the dear old place and to find everything exactly the same as ever you dont seem to have grown a day older uncle isaacnothing,0
is changed i cant tell you how delightful that is i had been tormenting myself during the journey with fancying i should find things alteredbut thank heaven they are not he glanced brightly at the broad rubicund face opposite to him and took his glass from the table your health uncle may you live a thousand years and may you be the same at the end of them he half emptied his glass and set it down with a cheery laugh isaac drank slowly from his peering meanwhile at his nephew over the rim thank you my lad he said replacing it on the table at last im obliged to you richard t is kindly meant but changes d ye seehere he paused and coughedchanges richard is what must be looked for in this here world his colour always sufficiently ruddy was now so much heightened and his face assumed so curiously solemn an expression that richard paused with his pipe halfway to his lips and stared at him with amazement and gathering alarm whats the matter he said anxi,0
ously are nt you feeling well youre looking firstrate never felt better in my life rejoined his uncle in sepulchral tones come thats all right you quite frightened me what do you mean by talking about changes isaac took a gulp from his tumbler and fixed his round eyes dismally on the young man there may be sich things as changes for the better he remarked still in his deepest bass dont believe in em cried richard gaily dont tell me youre going to turn methody or salvationist or anything of that kind i like you as you areand i dont want you to be any better dear heart alive what notions the chap d take in his head ejaculated the farmer relaxing into a smile nay now i never thought on sich things but therell be a change in this here house for all that richard i be agoinhere isaac leaned forward with a hand on either knee and fixed his eyes earnestly almost tragically on his nephewi be agoin richard for to change my state he slow,0
ly resumed an upright position drawing in his breath through dilated nostrils i be agoin richard he continued observing the others blank and uncomprehending starei be agoin to get married bless me exclaimed richard taken aback for a moment then rising from his chair he stepped up to his uncle and slapped him heartily on the back well done he cried well done i give you joy upon my life i did nt think you had so much go in youyoure a splendid old chap thank ee said isaac without much enthusiasm im glad youre not agen it why should i be against it returned richard hilariously im a little surprised because i did nt think that was in your line but after all marry in haste and repent at leisure the saying goesyour case is the reverse you have taken your time about marrying so perhaps it will be all the better for you i hope so im sure said the bridegroomelect dolefully adding as richard still laughing resumed his seat i thought,0

did nt ee yes but but nothin youre awoolgatherinthats it your thoughts is awanderin off to the new missus is not that to be expected returned his nephew idly resting his elbows on his knees and his chin in his hands he leaned forward gazing thoughtfully into the fire i have nt got over my surprise at your piece of news yet he said after a pause i thought you so determined a bachelor so i thought myself put in isaac with a nod and thenfrom what ive seen of mrs fiander i should never have imagined that she would be the wife you would choose when you did make up your mind to take one why so inquired isaac somewhat roughly shes so youngforty years younger than you i should think thirtynine corrected his uncle succinctly then she is so beautifulso full of life and spirit and dash i cant imagine how you came to think of her there was a pause during which isaac meditatively smoked and rubbed his knees well he said at last,0
i did nt exactly think of it myself ye seebut i could nt someways find it in my heart to say no to say what cried the young man dropping his hands and whisking round in his chair isaac gazed at him mildly and continued to polish his corduroys to say no he repeated slightly uplifting his voice and speaking very slowly and distinctly i say i could nt find it i my eart tosaynowhen she axed me she asked you do you mean to say that the proposal came from her his uncle nodded t war nt very likely it ud ha come fro me he remarked dispassionately as i told her at the time i never was a marryin man a silence ensued during which richard vainly endeavoured to readjust his ideas at length he said faintly and what did she say to that she said returned farmer sharpe stolidly that it would nt be a bad thing for met is a fine farm says she and a good business you could easy work the two farms together says she richard gazed at his uncle wit,0
h starting eyes and a dropping jaw but why in the name of fortune he ejaculated i could understand her marrying againbut why you she knowed id work the farm right d ye see things was goin wrong all round and she knowed i understood the work ah i told her myself at the time that she ought to look out for a younger man but she says i dont want no counterjumpers says shemeanin the branston folks ah there were a good few after her but she did nt fancy none o them she thought some was arter the money and none o them knowed anythin about dairyfarmin in fact struck in richard rising from his chair and beginning to pace hastily about the room she has proved herself to be a most practical woman you wont make away with her moneyyou wont allow mismanagement of the business jist so agreed his uncle sucking vigorously at his partially extinguished pipe richard continued to walk about the room and presently paused opposite the hearth did she make an off,0
er to elias fiander too he inquired sharply isaac removed his pipe and stared up at him the idea was evidently presented to him for the first time he never telled me so he said it were made up in a hurry to be sure lias had nt no notion o sich a thing when he started off from here he went arter a turniphoer arter her granfers death they sold en up poor old chap and rosaliethats mrs fianderhad nt nowhere to go ha remarked richard sardonically but i think pursued the farmer averting his eyes from his nephews face and gazing stolidly at the firei think twas lias as axed her ees now i can mind he told me so at the time me wantin a wife so bad says he and her bein such a good hand at the dairywork i thought id make sure o her he says she told him i suppose that she was a good hand at dairywork commented marshall yes i understand the matter now she is as i say a practical woman she isshe is agreed farmer sharpe warmly,0
she be a wonderful good manager manys the time ive said that ah i reckon i can say im in luck richard murmured something inarticulate and returned to his chair relighting his pipe and beginning to smoke without further remark on the opposite side of the hearth isaac ruminated contentedly without appearing to notice his nephews preoccupation and tumblers and pipes were emptied in almost unbroken silence when richard sought his room that nightthe familiar little atticroom which had been his in childhoodhis first act after a cursory glance of recognition and approval was to set down his candle on the little deal table and to draw carefully from his pocket a large envelope opening this he took out a print evidently cut from some illustrated paper or collection of pictures of the year holding it close to the light he looked at it intently underneath were the words a sleeping beauty followed by the artists name the picture represented a cornfield with a large shock of she,0
aves to the front beneath which lay the outstretched figure of a girl asleep even in this rough reproduction a certain likeness to rosalie was discernible and richards fancy supplied the rest indeed as he gazed he contemplated not only the glowing and highlyfinished work of art which had haunted him persistently since he had first beheld it but the vision of that afternoonthe exquisite face the lithe graceful form which had suddenly appeared to him against its background of bloom and sunlit green he seemed to hear again the blithe young voice which had thrilled him as it prattled at his side he seemed to see the large eyes lifted a little shyly to his and then modestly dropped because of his too evident admiration he had deemed these things the outward indication of absolute womanly perfection his young imagination fired by the unexpected meeting with rosalie and further stimulated by his uncles chance remarks had created a marvellous romance before isaac had pronounced the name of h,0

extinguishing the flame with his finger and thumb and rubbing the burnt edge ruefully this at least is a thing of beauty he said why destroy it then hastily restoring the print to its wrapper and thrusting it into his pocket again he muttered i wish i had never seen her chapter iii butter rolls ot cream why bowls ot william barnes come come away or let me go must i here stay troth lady no herrick isaac was somewhat disappointed at his nephews lack of enthusiasm over a project which had at first seemed to take his fancy so much talk as he might about richards future and his own desire that he should pass the remainder of his days on the down farm he could extract nothing from the young man but vague expressions of gratitude and a doubtful promise to think the matter over im goin up yonder,0

uent on his uncles disclosures was ready to take alarm at every trivial detail rosalies pallor and the slightly drawn look on her faceboth due in reality to a sleepless night resulting from an unaccountable perturbation of mindwere immediately attributed to an acute and unreasonable disappointment over an insignificant money loss the eyes which had gazed on rosalie so ardently yesterday were now busily tracing lines of fancied meanness in her face those frowning brows surely revealed the shrew the compressed lips spoke of parsimony when that lovely colour faded and those clearcut features had become coarsened by age and selfimposed toil what would remain none of that beauty of soul which he had thought to find there well well remarked isaac placidly these accidents will happen but i would nt advise ee to be cast down by em these here curds d seem to be asettin all right i know how t is wi young folks a body has to stand over them all the time why when we be ashe,0

outweigh every other consideration it is obvious nothing like a womans clear head for solving a difficulty i will take your advice rosalies pretty face wore a look of such absolute bewilderment and she was evidently so much at a loss to account for his sarcastic tone that richard suddenly burst out laughing the cloud lifted from his brow giving place to an expression of frank goodhumour uncle isaac he cried clapping him heartily on the shoulder forgive my chopping and changing so often this time my mind is made up i accept your offer shake hands on it chapter iv the blackthornflower hath fallen away the blackthornflower that wise men say keeps wild and variable skies as long as it may stay but heres the gorse and heres the whin and here the pearld may appears and poisonweeds of satin skin through every bank prick long green ears to hear the cuckoocries elinor sw,0

sion during the past weeks he had laughed himself out of his whilom fancy for the fascinating and disappointing widow he had even taken himself to task somewhat severely for his strictures on that unconscious young woman was it her fault after all that her outer parts belied her real self why had he been so unreasonably angry because she had failed to correspond to the high estimate which he had formed on slight and inadequate premises she was a very beautiful creature and no doubt good enough in her way if she was commonplace and had a sharp eye for the main chance she would make the better wife to a practical farmer he would in all probability get on well enough with her when she became his aunt but meanwhile life was too full of congenial work and evergrowing interest to admit of his wasting time in improving his acquaintance with the future mrs sharpe he had thrown himself into his new pursuits with characteristic energy and found them daily more and more engrossing he possesse,0

d she loosed the branch which flew rustling up to join its fellows and made a step forward he could see her face more clearly now the gleam of her white teeth between her parted lips he even fancied that he could detect an angry sparkle in her eyes why do you come here she said here at least i supposed myself safe i came replied richard in an unsteady voice to beg your pardon most humbly most sincerely for my conduct to you today it was inexcusable she said after a pause it seemed to him that she was breathing quicklyperhaps with a just and natural anger i do not attempt to excuse it he murmured i cannot even understand it she pursued what had i done to you how do my private concerns affect you there was a long silence and then richard said almost in a whisper i can make no excusei think i must have been mad when i came to myself i feltas if i could kill myself for my brutality to you all day the shame of it has been eating into my souli feel b,0

the whole place was wrapped in sabbath stillness milking was over and a distant line of red and dappled cows was vanishing down the lane followed by one or two of the dairy chaps with white pinners protecting their sunday clothes save for the calves which thrust their blunt moist noses through the bars of their enclosure and the fowl cackling lazily as they lay sunning themselves in the angle of the barn the barton was absolutely deserted we drained the big mead four years ago said rosalie and threw the twentyacre into it t is beautiful pasture now would you like to see it richard hurriedly expressed a desire to that effect and the two betook themselves in silence along a narrow farmtrack to the rear of the house which led to the field in question they walked with the breadth of the lane between them and in unbroken silence their eyes by common accord gazing straight in front and both secretly rebelling against the expedient which isaac had deemed so happily devised at,0
length they came to a gate set in the hedge and turned to look over it a great green expanse stretched away before their gaze meeting the skyline on one side where it sloped upwards and melting on the other into the lighter more delicate green of springing corn beyond were the woods which as well as the low line of hills behind them were covered by a gentle haze richard leaned his elbows on the topmost rail of the gate and his face gradually cleared as his eyes roamed over the landscape this county of dorset has given birth to more than one great writer of lowly origin whose early nurture amid field and heath and woodland has fostered an intimate and loving sympathy with nature to which each in turn has given exquisite expression richard marshall born of the same sturdy peasant stock brought up amid the same pastoral surroundings possessed a somewhat kindred spirit though he was denied this gift of expression yet the inglorious rustic milton was not always mute he had read so muc,0
h and meditated so much and above all felt so deeply that at times something of what he thought and felt struggled to his lips and found vent in words inadequate indeed but suggestive how beautiful it all is he said turning to rosalie with a very poets rapture in his eyes it seems to fill one like music yet i suppose you have seen far finer sights during your travels returned she speaking naturally for the first time as she too leaned over the gate finer things oh yes perhaps but this homely beauty touches me as no other sight could do something about a great sketch of green like this always affects me curiously i love these wide fields yes i remember your saying so said rosalie the ice was broken now and she could talk to him freely even taking courage to broach a subject which had much occupied her thoughts lately you told me you know how pleased you were at the sight of the cornfield inin my picture he did not turn towards her and continued to scan,0
the mead but over his brown face she saw the colour rush quickly oh yes he said of course i remember telling you about it i wanted to ask you waswas the picture a very large one and was it well painted yes very large indeed and beautifully painted there was an iron railing in front of it because people pressed round it so i was told it was the picture of the year was it cried rosalie and at the note of delight in her voice he turned and looked at her with a smile her cheeks were pink with excitement her eyes shining oh she cried with a sigh of longing i would give anything to see it i have a little print of it here returned he impulsively i cut it out of a paper it will give you some idea of it though of course a very poor one in another moment he partly withdrew from its enclosure the print in question holding the envelope firmly in his own hand however so that the charred margin was hidden see he said pointing with his disengaged hand ther,0
e is your houseover there in the corner and here are your men and here under the piledup sheaves are you but of course the figure in the picture is far more like you i see said rosalie yes it must be a nice picture and you say it is beautifully done it is beautifully done it is so real so vivid that i felt as if i could walk into the picture these sheaves stand out so that one might think it easy to pass behind them he glanced up as he said these words and was surprised to see rosalie colour almost to the temples his own heart gave a sudden throb was it possible that she had divined the audacious thought which had so often come to him as he recalled that picture and which since his uncles revelations he had resolutely striven to banish as a matter of fact there did happen to be a certain similarity between this thought of his and that which had caused rosalie to change colour for there had flashed across her mind the remembrance of the unknown artists words perha,0
ps if i come across a very attractive specimen of a rustic i may place him just behind the stook this is the name underneath i suppose she said hastily what is the picture called i cannot see from here it is called a sleeping beauty returned richard she was dumb for a moment hot waves of colour rushing over brow and neck what was it the man had said last year you will wake up some day my beauty words of ill omen they had often tantalised and tormented her but now as they recurred to her her heart seemed to stand still ashamed of her burning face on which the young mans eyes were now fixed and of the agitation which she could not master she suddenly bent forward confusedly what is the name of the painter let me look before richard could divine her intention she had snatched the print from his hand its black and jagged edges immediately catching her eye why she said in an altered tonewhy it is burnt it was now richards turn to look confused i be,0
gan to burn it but repented of my intention you wanted to burn it said rosalie because you were so angry with me why were you so angry with me was it because ofof what your uncle told you yes i know he did not mean to do me harm said rosalie tremulously but i dont think hehe can have made you understand properly everything was going wrong andand i was so much bothered i found i could not manage by myself and he had been my poor eliass friendshe was beginning to sob nowand i knew i could trust him not to do anything elias would nt have liked andoh it is so difficult to explain pray do not try to explain said richard very gently but you should nt misjudge me as you do cried she and then burst into tears i do not misjudge you now said richard in a low voice oh dont cry i assure you i understand you have been quite rightquite right all along the big tearful blue eyes looked at him over the crumpled handkerchief but you saidyou said i so,0
ld myself she gasped you should nt have said that i loved my husband i am sure you did said richard gravely and tenderly yes indeed i did i loved him from the first he was like a father to me yes yes said richard and he looked at her with an odd mixture of wonder and compassion he was just as kind and dotingly fond of me as my own dear granfer to be sure said richard yes no wonder you loved him something in his tone caused rosalie to pull down her handkerchief and to cast a keen glance at him why do you look at me like that she said passionately was i looking at you in any particular way returned he averting his eyes quickly yes you were you were looking at me as if you were sorry for me how dare you be sorry for me were you not telling me he said quietly how much you felt the loss of your good old husband you know it was not that she retorted you looked at me as if i were a child who had no senseas if i did not know what i was,0
saying did i said richard i beg your pardon is that what you really think of me pursued she her eyes full of wrathful fire though the tears were still standing on her cheeks answer mei insist on your answering me richards gaze had been fixed on the little print which she was holding and rosalie marking this had felt an increase of indignation did he dare to share the opinion which the artist had so impertinently pronounced rousing himself however he turned towards her and their eyes met i do think he said that you know very little of life perhaps it is all the better for you the fruit of the tree of knowledge is nearly always bitterand sometimes it is poisonous rosalie was about to make a very angry rejoinder when the sound of steps close to them made them both suddenly start on looking round they beheld a loving couple such as are so frequently to be met with in rural districts on sunday afternoons sauntering down the lane rosalie hastily restored her ha,0
ndkerchief to her pocket and again leaned over the gate endeavouring to assume a careless attitude but she was secretly much annoyed for the young man who was so gallantly escorting a much befringed and beribboned lady was no other than sam belbin at any other time she would have been somewhat amused on discovering how soon her lowly admirer had consoled himself he was working at branston now and his companion was evidently a townswoman but that he should come on her just then in the midst of her tears and wrath with richard marshall in such close proximity was most vexatious sam stared hard as he approached taking in as rosalie felt though she did not again look towards him every compromising detail of the situation when they had passed on he made some facetious remark to the girl on whose arm he was hanging to which she responded by loud laughter the little incident impressed rosalie disagreeably she turned to richard petulantly holding out the little print which had been the cause,0
of so much agitation you had better finish burning this she said perhaps i had returned he with unexpected docility isaac looked so placid and cheery when they entered and greeted them with so bright a smile that rosalie was conscious of a sudden rush of remorse going up to him she placed her hand upon his shoulder a caress which astonished its recipient mightily for he was not accustomed to endearments from her rosalie kept her hand there however glancing defiantly at richard the while as though to say you are wrong in thinking me so ignorant see how i love and appreciate this good man and richard smiled back kindly as if replying i see it indeed and i am glad that you are content well said isaac squinting down sideways at rosalies hand well mrs f did you take en all over the place i took mr marshall to see the big mead returned she a little doubtfully ah im sure he thought that improved well and then you took en up to see the root crop n,0
ono we did nt go there we did nt like to go too far as you were here by yourself why i were all right here isaac slowly lifted the shoulder on which rosalies hand still lingered and again glanced down at it as taking the hint she withdrew it he gently rubbed the place where it had rested you took en down to the carnfield though he continued ill engage he thought them oats was acomin on wonderful but they had not been to the cornfield it appeared nor yet to see the potatoes nor round by the vegetable garden nor through the orchard they had just been to the big mead and back well commented mr sharpe gazing at them in amazement ye must ha walked oncommon slow we stood for some time looking at the view said richard seeing rosalie somewhat confounded lookin at the view eh echoed his uncle there baint any view to speak on from the mead if youd ha gone a bit further up the lane and turned the corner yed ha had a beautiful view o branston,0
but if you enjyed yourselves its all right he wheeled round in his chair as he made this last remark and looked from one to the other of the young folks both faces were alike downcast and somewhat paler than usual after a moments scrutiny isaac became as crestfallen as they so long as you enjyed yourselves he repeated slowly so long as yeve amade friendsi want ee to be friends d ye see rosalie and richard glanced at each other he read in her face a kind of antagonism mingled with fear and dropped his eyes quickly lest they might betray the anguish and longing with which his heart was full to bursting i want ee to be friends d ye see repeated the farmer anxiously and pleadingly theres me and you mrs f as friendly as can be and theres you and me richardyoure much the sames a son to me baint yewell then theres you and mrs f why should nt ee be friendly wi her richard to whom the question was directed remained dumb friends could they eve,0
r be friends rosalie however made a step forward and extended her hand why should we not indeed she said to tell you the truth isaac we have done nothing but quarrel since we first met each other which was very silly and unreasonable of us now for your sake i am determined not to quarrel any more and for your sake i think he too should be willing to keep the peace well said cried isaac heartily well said mrs f now richard my boy wheres your hand just catch hold o mrs fs thats itthats it shake it well here he thumped the arm of his chair jubilantly youll be the best o friends from this day forard here we be we three friends all jist as me and poor lias and mrs f was friendsdear heart alive yes we was friends toothe best o friends we was three then and we be three now baint us mrs f we three i do mind a old song as your poor dear mother used to sing richard when shall we three meet agen in starm in zunshine ar,0
in rain lard yes she used to sing it poor soul well now we be three agen baint us three good friends so if youll mix the usul glass mrs f well drink to the bond o good fellowship yes of course said rosalie indistinctly i forgot all about your glass isaac im so sorry ill see to it at once she ran out of the room glad to make her escape and richard sat down near the hearth friends they were to be friends as his uncle and elias and rosalie had once been friends he had felt her hand twitch in his as isaac had spoken to her the proposition was doubtless as distasteful as to him it was impossible what was his uncle thinking of there were some things which flesh and bloodyoung flesh and bloodcould not brook and this triangular bond was one of them but he would be patient for a little while he would choke down his rebellious sense of injury his secret thank heaven was secure neither the guileless isaac nor rosalie herself had the faintest idea of the,0
miserable passion which he was striving so hard to conquer what was it she had said they were to be friendsfriends for his uncles sake his uncle to whom he owed everythinghis kind faithful generous old benefactor well he would try that night in the seclusion of his attic room he once more drew forth rosalies picture sleep on beauty he said sleep on in peace i shall not try to wake you sleep soundly do not even dream and after a last silent look he held it steadily in the flame of the candle watching its destruction unflinchingly until the last feathery film dropped from his fingers chapter vii and times he saith why must man aye forego and why is life a nobler thing through pain and times since loves sweet apple hangs so low shall i not strongly grasp and count it gain elinor sweetman for some time after isaacs apparently successful peacemaking the friendly relations between,0
the parties concerned remained unbroken richard was frequently sent on messages to littlecomb acquitting himself on these occasions in a strictly businesslike manner and when he accompanied his uncle thither he made such strenuous efforts to appear at his ease and to entertain its hostess that isaac was delighted beyond measure how th chap d talk he would say sometimes under his breath with an admiring nod and wink bless me he d talk like prent i d low there is nt very much as my nevvy dont know richard indeed in his desire to avoid those terrible long silences which had so much discomposed him during his first visits to littlecomb embarked upon wild flights of fancy related at length his past experiences and delivered his opinion upon men and things with a fluency which frequently surprised himself the fact was that he was afraid to pause were he to come to a halt when those blue eyes were fixed upon him could he ever take up the thread of his discourse again even as it,0
was the mere consciousness of that intent gaze made him sometimes falter but recovering himself he would go on with a rush knowing that he was making many wild statements but persevering nevertheless he was bound to do all the talking if talking there must be for rosalie was very silent and his uncle was at no time garrulous but the harmony of these relations was rudely broken by an unexpected incident one warm afternoon early in june farmer sharpe chanced to be standing by his own gate gazing abstractedly up and down the lane presently he descried an undersized narrowchested figure making its way towards him and as it drew near recognised mr samuel cross fine evenin remarked isaac nodding sideways in his direction and expecting him to pass on a very fine evening mr sharpe returned samuel pausing and leaning against the gatepost with the evident intention of entering into conversation the very evenin for a quiet walk walkin baint much in my line returned,0
isaac nay not without im obliged toseein after the men and goin round the fields and across the downs to look after the sheep but walkinmeanin goin for a walk jist for pleasureit baint in my line at all its in other peoples line though said samuel and he shot a cunning glance at the older man out of his little redrimmed eyes i met your nephew strolling up towards littlecomb just now very like ye did agreed sharpe he do often go up there on business lucky chap exclaimed cross the rest of us dont often contrive to make business agree so well with pleasure he paused to snigger and isaac turned his mild grey eyes inquiringly upon him nay samuel cross he remarked i dont suppose as you do the slight stress laid upon the personal pronoun appeared to irritate the young gentleman and he replied with a certain acerbity there is nt as a rule much pleasure to be found in doing honest business mr sharpe not among lawyers said isaac nodding,0
placidly so ive been told theres others besides lawyers though cried samuel as are nt so very honest he he youre a very confiding man mr sharpea very confiding uncle t is nt everyone in your situation that would care to make such a handsome young man his businessmanager where a handsome young woman was concerned he he your nephew no doubt will do the business thoroughlyperhaps a little too thoroughly my nevvy returned isaac loftily may be trusted to do his dooty samel t is more nor can be said for many folks as be all for pokin their noses where they baint wanted mr crosss always sallow complexion assumed an even more jaundiced hue as he retorted most people do no business on sundayin england they dont at least but i suppose mr richard marshall has brought foreign notions back with him he was seen two or three weeks ago doing business with mrs fiander quite as per usual they were standin close together lookin over a gate just as if he a,0
nd she were keepin company and he was tellin her such touchin business details that she was actually crying mr sharpe cryin ejaculated isaac in a kind of roar stuff and nonsense what had she to cry for how should i know because prices had gone down i suppose since according to you they talk nothing but business when they are together oh drop that cried the farmer losing patience at last what be you adrivin at samel cross wi your hints why rejoined samuel thrusting his thumbs into his waistcoat pocketswhy the remark as was passed by the young man that saw them in the lane will perhaps throw some light on the subject says he i believe he says as the widow fiander be atakin on wi the new love before she is off wi the old so if i do drop a hint mr sharpeand samuel assumed a virtuous air and struck an appropriate attitudei do it in the way of kindness take my advice and look sharplook like your name sir we lawyers see a deal of the,0
world a deal of the wickedness of the world and we know that worthy folks are often caught napping but dont you be caught farmerkeep a good lookout or your bride will be snapped up from under your very nose now ill tell you what it is samel cross cried isaac who had been shifting from one foot to the other during the latter part of the clerks speech and was purple in the face with suppressed ire since youre so fond of advice maybe youll take a bit from me jist you keep that long tongue o yourn quiet what do ye mean ye little treecherous spy by poking your nose into other peoples business and tryin to make mischief between them thats as good as father and son i know my nevvy a deal better than you know him my nevvy baint a snapper an so i tell ee now you jist take yourself off out of this and dont ee come here wi no more lyin tales else maybe yell find this here stick o mine laid about your shoulders i baint so strong as i were but i could make a shift to,0
hit ee a crack or twoso now ye know samuel had started back as words and gestures grew threatening and now deemed it better to beat a retreat turning however at a safe distance to bestow a withering valedictory smile upon his adversary and to remark that he was sorry for him ever since his rejection by rosalie he had been burning with resentment against her and desirous of an opportunity of venting it a chance meeting with sam belbin had resulted in the latters imparting to him a highlycoloured version of the scene which he had witnessed between rosalie and richard in the lane the desired opportunity seemed to have arrived and samuel had hastened to take advantage of it with as has been seen indifferent success as he now hastened away as rapidly as his short legs would carry him he encountered the very person he had been so anxious to traduce richard nodded and would have passed on but that cross who was still suffering from a redundancy of spite thought the opportunity favoura,0
ble for venting it you are back already he remarked i wonder you did nt contrive to be a bit longer over your business you would nt ha been missed yonder your uncle seems quite content with your doings as i told him just nowhe has a confiding nature what do you mean said richard speaking in a low even voice but with an ominous flash of the eyes ha you know what i mean well enough you sly young dog if you dont ask the fascinating young widowask lovely dainty mrs f she knows what shes about though she contrives to look so demure come marking the expression of richards face you need nt turn rusty over itill tell no tales bless you but theres others besides me that has been passing remarks about the widow fianders new businessmanager ha hayou may carry on though as far as i am concernedperhaps i know a little too much about the lady to envy you she has played a double game before now as for the old man hell find out nothing hes as blind,0
as a batas blind as a bat here mr cross thrust his tongue into his cheek and made a hideous contortion of countenance calculated to convey an impression of his own extreme artfulness and of his contempt for the old farmers shortsightedness his own vision perhaps might with advantage have been a little clearer a man of quicker perceptions would have realised that richards persistent silence was more fraught with danger to him than a torrent of wrathful words he was therefore considerably surprised when marshall suddenly brought down his vigorous right hand upon the cheek at that moment distended by samuels malevolent tongue and before he had time to spring backwards the other palm inflicted similar chastisement on its fellow the lawyers clerk gasped spluttered and finally uttered a choking howl hang you youve made me nearly bite my tongue off serve you right if i had cried richard you little reptile if you so much as say another word of this kind ill half kill you,0
he had seized samuel by the shoulders and was now shaking him slowly backwards and forwards do you take back every word of your vile slanders yeyeyes gasped cross in an agony of terror will you give me your word to keep that foul tongue of yours quiet in future oh lord yes richard marshall for heavens sake let me go youve about half killed me as it is richard released him with a parting admonition to look out and cross went on his way with a staggering gait and stuffing his pockethandkerchief into his mouth richard still in a white heat of passion was striding along at a tremendous rate when he suddenly observed the large whiteclad person of his uncle standing contemplatively some twenty yards away from the scene of the encounter his good humoured face wore a pleasant and satisfied smile well done lad he remarked as soon as richard came within hearing ye did give it en in style i never did see nothing more neat i do rather think richard as mr samel c,0

i were but i could make shift to hit ee a crack or two yet i wish i had thrashed him within an inch of his life came the savage comment thrown over richards shoulder lard richard how you do lay them long legs o yourn to the ground panted isaac pausing to wipe his brow im fair out o breath bide a bitbide a bit let me blow there dont ee be in sich a takin lad i reckon them there little taps as ye gave samel cross ull keep en quiet for some time he be gone tother way anyhow and it wont do ee no good to run me off my legs richard came slowly back his face was fixed and stern but he spoke more quietly uncle i blame myself to a certain extent for what has happened i might have guessed that in a gossiping little place like this people would talk if i went so often to littlecomb i must keep away altogether for the present nay now dont ee let yourself get so upset what signifies a bit of idle chatter you dont need to take no notice of it at all,0
but i will take notice of it cried richard i dont choose that people should take liberties with my name and what is worsewith hers i need not assure you uncle isaac that i have never said one word to mrs fiander that anyone need find fault with to be sure agreed isaac of course not he came to a sudden pause however and cast a sidelong look at his nephew scratching his jaw meditatively there was one dayone sundaysamel cross was asayin somebody seed you both standin alookin over a gate and mrs f was acryin that was nt very likely i dont think t was nt very likely as youd say aught as ud make mrs f cry richard drew a quick breath and his hands involuntarily clenched themselves she did cry one day he said it was the first sunday you took me to littlecomb she imaginedhesitatinglythat i had a bad opinion of her and she cried and said i was unjust thatll be the day you went to see the big mead said farmer sharpe reflectively ye h,0
ad nt made friends then ye have nt made her cry since richard have ee of course not women be so fanciful ye did nt really have a bad opinion of her richard far from it she be a very dear womana very dear woman t is nt very likely as anybody ud have a bad opinion of mrs f well ye be real trew friends now and ye dont need to take no notice of idle talk let there be no coolness between ye on that account richard however remained fixed in his determination to avoid littlecomb for the future and in spite of his uncles protests adhered to his resolution on the following sunday he was somewhat discomposed to find rosalies eyes straying towards him once or twice as he knelt on the opposite side of the church and it seemed to him that they wore a questioning pleading expression his purpose however remained unshaken and immediately after the early dinner he went out without saying anything to his uncle and could not be found when the hour came for their weekly,0
pilgrimage to littlecomb after waiting some time and vainly bellowing his name the farmer was obliged to go without him richard was in a very taciturn mode at the evening meal and his uncles announcement that mrs f had inquired why he had not come and remarked that she saw nothing of him nowadays did not render him more inclined for conversation after supper too instead of smoking quietly he sat fidgeting in his chair for a few minutes and then rising hastily fell to pacing about the room you seem mortal onaisy this evening remarked the farmer after these perambulations had continued some time sit down and light up like a decent christian he pushed forward a chair invitingly with his foot and richard took it and drew his pipe from his pocket ugh how hot and stuffy it was in this kitchen where in spite of the warm weather a fire was blazing the windows had not been opened all day he felt sure the odour of their recent repast still lingered in the air mingled with the,0
fumes of the particularly rank pipe which his uncle was then enjoying he thought of the cool twilight without of the downs with the fresh breeze blowing across them of the path beside the hedge that led to littlecomb of the garden therethe garden where the thrush was singing and where the roses and syringa were in full bloom ah he could picture to himself the syringa with its white blossoms shining like pale lamps amid the dusky boughs the garden still and sweet and dewywhere she was wandering at this hour light up man said isaac pointing to richards pipe his nephew obeyed but held it absently between his fingers isaac poked the blazing logs with his foot and bent forward extending his hands to the glow his big red face looked unnaturally large through the surrounding haze of smoke richard half rose from his chair and then sank back again outside came the tantalising thought again outsidea few paces away were the downs and the lonely path through the fields and then th,0
e garden the farmer was slowly nodding in the comfortable radiance richards unused pipe had gone out the garden the garden suddenly he rose from his chair strode across the room flung open the door and was gone before his uncle had time to do more than turn his head chapter viii away the moor is dark beneath the moon rapid clouds have drunk the last pale beam of even away the gathering winds will call the darkness soon and profoundest midnight shroud the serene lights of heaven pause not the time is past every voice cries away shelley once outside richard flew along as though pursued by a thousand demons here were the downs with their delicious tart airbut he raced across them without pausing to inhale it now to swing over the hedge and to cover the ground that still lay between him and the garden the garden and her his heart was thumping loudly against his ribs a sound as of,0
a rushing sea was in his ears on on there were the lights twinkling from under the dark eavesthere was the gate set in the high wall how it shook beneath his violent hand as he flung it open he stood still at last hardly breathing in his suspense was she there all was still save for the rustling of the boughs and the faint warbling of the birdsmore than one was celebrating evensong tonight what if she should not be there he walked on slowly and unsteadily now and presently there was a movement amid the greenery close at hand out of a little arbour set amid the shrubs a figure came gliding forth to meet him she paused two paces away from him and her hands fell by her sides it is you she said almost in a whisper yes it is i they stood facing each other in unbroken silence for a full minute and then she asked still in that breathless whisper why did you come because i could not keep away she turned and began slowly to pace down the path between the roses waves,0
of perfume were wafted to their nostrils from the syringa blossom yes yonder stood the bush just as he had pictured to himself the remembrance suddenly flashed across richard as he walked beside her that these shrubs were sometimes called mock orange trees mock orange trees mock orange blossomhe must not pursue that thought further i kept away for four days he said suddenly i tried to keep away today after a long pause she faltered i was wondering why you did not come he made no answer and they walked in silence till the end of the path was reached and then she said still falteringly i dont think you ought to have come now i know i ought not they turned and began to retrace their steps but when about midway up the garden she came to a standstill and looked him full in the face go now she said go you must not stay here any longer even in the dim light he could see that she was pale and that her figure wavered but he gazed at her as though without,0
realising the sense of her words will you not leave me she entreated when i ask you he stood looking at her stupidly for a moment or two longer then the meaning of her request seemed to reach his understanding i will go he said hoarsely if you will give me those flowers in your hand how foolish you are she cried there yes take them and for heavens sake go she thrust them towards him and he took them from her handa cluster of roses moist and sweet instead of fulfilling his promise however he made a step closer to her will you put them in my coat he asked his eyes in his haggard face seemed to burn no said rosalie drawing back the movement and the icy tone that accompanied it recalled him to himself he too drew back hesitated and then throwing the flowers on the ground with a passionate gesture departed back again through the gate across the yard under the lea of the hedge over the downs here was home there was the warm light of the fire by,0
which his uncle sat now the door was open and he stood once more in his presence now he richard would be forced to look him in the face for a moment he stood with the doorhandle in his hand and then as the old man turned to smile inquiringly upon him he suddenly wheeled and fled i cant he cried as he mounted the stairs i cant isaac stared at the closed door for some moments as though expecting it to open again then slowly turning back to the fire listened in the room overhead hasty steps were walking up and down he be gone to fetch summat very like remarked the farmer as he restored his pipe to his mouth but after smoking and listening a little longer and marking that the pacing to and fro continued without intermission he jerked his thumb upwards nodded and said he baint acomin back then after pausing a moment to ruminate over this circumstance he made up his mind to the inevitable tapped his pipe upon the hob extinguished the lamp and went upstairs t,0
o bed and long after he was sunk in dreamless slumbers those hasty footsteps might have been heard in the adjoining room pacing up and down up and down like the restless tread of a caged beast richard was not the only one who spent an unquiet night rosalie too could find no rest for her aching heart after some hours of feverish tossing she rose dressed in the dim grey light that was just stealing over the world and seated herself by the open window she could meditate here without risk of being disturbed for the sun would not rise for an hour and more and even the earliest of her men would not appear until some time after dawn with her chin resting on her hand she hearkened vaguely to the succession of sounds which betokened the awakening of nature the cock had crowed long before she had left her uneasy pillow the young sparrows had been chirping while she had clothed her weary frame but now the cuckoos note was sounding faintly from a neighbouring copse and the starlings were chatt,0
ering in their nests on the ivied wall the grey veil was being gradually withdrawn from the face of the earth but even yet familiar objects were only half revealed and the most wellknown had a strange and unreal look the first sunbeam had not yet struck across the sky when rosalie whose eyes had been absently fixed upon the irregular line of hedge which marked the approach to the barton saw a dark object moving slowly along it and presently into the open space before her gate there stepped the figure of a man she knew what man it was even before he had vaulted the locked gate and taken up his stand beneath her window she would have given worlds to close this window and hasten out of sight but a spell seemed to be laid upon her and she could neither move nor speak only gaze downward with dilated frightened eyes you are there said richard looking up with a face as drawn and white as her own thank god i wanted to see you before i go i wanted to say goodbye the power of speech re,0
turned to her and she leaned forth impulsively with a faint cry going you are going yes i am going is it not the only thing i can do do you think i can bear to sit at his table and take his pay and know that i am a traitor to him in my heart rosalie did not speak but richard gazing upwards saw the clasp of her hands tighten as they rested on the sill till the nails and knuckles showed white he went on passionately every word he says to me stabs me every time i look at his honest unsuspicious face i feelsurely you must know what i feel im not quite a brute yet and later when you are his wifedo you think it would be possible for me to go on living within a stones throwto see you every dayto keep up the farce of friendship what do you think i am made of her face was set like marble only the eyes moved after a long pause she whispered will youever come back who knows he answered with a harsh laugh some time perhapswhen i am quite oldwhen i can no lon,0
ger feel she put her hand before her eyes and then let it drop richard saw the irrepressible anguish in them and his face changed he threw up his arms suddenly with a kind of a sob i will not goif you tell me to stay for a moment longer the agonised eyes looked down into his and he thought he saw her waver but it was only for a moment her lips moved at first without emitting any sound but presently mastering herself she said firmly no i tell you to goit is right for you to go goodbye said richard hoarsely goodbye faltered rosalie and then there came a great sob god bless you he turned as if to leave her but wheeling round looked back am i to have nothing am i to be sent away without so much as a clasp of the hand she had vanished from the window and for a moment he stood holding his breath would she come down to himwould she meet him at the door but within all was silent she will not come he said to himself and once more went on his way stag,0
gering blindly forward with his head sunk upon his breast had he looked back again he might have seen her creep to the window and kneel by it straining her eyes through streaming tears poor rosalie poor beauty did she wake at last only to look upon the vanishing form of her prince later in the day isaac sharpe came to littlecomb in great perturbation of mind he found rosalie lying on the couch in the parlour the blind being drawn downshe had a headache she said dear heart alive said isaac sitting down a hand on either knee everything d seem to be goin wrong this day heres my nevvy gone off wi himself gone echoed rosalie faintly turning her face to the wall ees took himself off this morning wiout a word to anyone and left this here bit of a note for to explain i baint much of a hand at letter readin but bithey did read it for me and he does nt seem to give no excuse at all except that he were feelin restless,0
he says he alays told me he were a rover and could nt settle down and now the travellin fit have come on him and he felt he must be off and he thanks me very handsome and he tells me he dont know where he be agoin to yet but when he does hell write and let me know where to send his luggage and thats all thats all repeated rosalie looking at the kind troubled old face with a bewildered stare that was all of course and she had known it before she had with her own eyes watched richards departing figure until it had disappeared from sight she had known quite well that he would never return she had even told him to go agreed with him that it was the right and honourable thing to dothe only thing to do ever since the morning she had been telling herself so over and over again yet none the less the farmers words fell like a knell upon her heart you do look bad to be surei am sorry your head be so bad lard lard what a world this be im that upset i dont know whether,0
im on my head or my heels the quaver in his voice smote rosalie she must make an effort to overcome her selfish grief above all to conquer that mad spirit of rebellion which every now and then rose rampant within her this good man had need of her sympathy should she not give it all the more willingly that there was so large an element of remorse mingled with her misery she sat up and looked affectionately towards him im very very sorry for you she said t was so sudden ye see pursued isaac dolefully he never so much as said a word to inever so much as hinted as he war nt satisfied i mid ha seen that the restless fit were acomin on if i had nt ha been sich a sammy restless he were that restless last night he were more like a dog at a fair as had lost his master nor a reasonable human being it was up and down and in and out the whole blessed evening ah i be terrible upset i be oncommon fond o richard d ye see always was from the time he were a little un,0
i was oncommon fond o his mother afore him she were the only woman i ever could put up wipresent company excepted as isaac ducked his head towards her with a melancholy attempt at jocularity rosalies heart sank lower still she turned away hastily that he might not see her face at an earlier period she might have been gratified by the knowledge that she was one of the few women in the world whom isaac sharpe could put up withphrases of the kind were his nearest approach to ardour and indicated as she knew a considerable amount of solid attachment but the passionate tones of richards voice had rung too recently in her earthe look in his eyes was too fresh in her memory ah what had she not seen in those eyes ees went on her unconscious future husband ees ill be like to miss en him and me was the best of friendsand thats not all his leaving me like this be terrible illconvenient just nowt is the busy time of year dye seehaymaking timeevery pair o hands is wanted r,0
ichard did very near the work o two men and he must go trapesing off wi hisself giving me no time at all to find somebody to take his place there was a distinct sense of injury in his tone now i am sure he never thought of that cried rosalie quickly and resentfully how could isaac find it in his heart to think of such things in the face of the overwhelming fact that richard was gone ah sure he did nt agreed isaac t is a very bad job a very bad job indeed but i suppose there baint nothing to be done rosalie agreed with a sigh it was too true there was nothing to be done chapter ix labsence est lamour ce quest au feu le vent il teint le petit mais it allume le grand several days passed and richard made no sign rosalie went about looking like the ghost of herself it was known that she was suffering from a very severe attack of neuralgia which oddly enough had first seized her on the very day of richard marshalls sudden departure some,0
guileless people believed in the neuralgiapoor mrs fiander did look so very bad and a body could nt make believe to be so pale others among whom was mrs belbin folded their arms and assumed a knowing air t was likely enough averred this matron for folks to look pale as had reason to mrs fianders conscience was very likely atroublin o she she was a terrible one for carryin on wi young menaleadin of them on and then asendin them off wiout no reason her sam could say somethin if he d a mindher sam did know more than he did like to talk about others again were of opinion that mrs fiander was just wasting away for love of mr sharpes nephew and that that young man had gone of his own accord and had not been dismissed by the widow t was nt very likely said these sages that richard marshall who had his own way to make in the world and who was known to have great expectations from his uncle would wish to have any unpleasantness with him in response to the suggesti,0
on that the young man would nt be adoin so very bad for hisself if he and widow fiander made a match of it they returned conclusively that it was quite unpossible for him and widow fiander to make a match of it since her banns were to be given out almost immediately with farmer sharpe somebody had up and axed mrs fiander when the wedding was to be and she had answered that the day was not yet fixed but that the wedding was to take place as agreed at the end of july isaac heard none of these rumours but he too wandered about with an unusually lengthy and gloomy face one day however rosalie looking out from the darkened room where she was sitting saw him hastening towards her house with every appearance of excitement waving a piece of paper in his hand in a moment she stood on the threshold you have heard from richard she cried eagerly you have had a letter nay my dear i have nt had no letter panted isaac as soon as he was near enough i ve had a graft you have had,0
what inquired rosalie i have had a graft my dear a telegraftin one of them nastylookin yeller wrappers as alays seems to bring bad news i hope it has nt brought bad news this time said she tremulously as they went into the house together nay i hope not said the farmer doubtfully it does nt say much d ye seenot much one way or t other smoothing out the paper he handed it to her upside down rosalie reversed it and read the brief message send luggage as soon as possible lime street station liverpool to be called forrichard liverpool then he must intend to go to america again isaac flushed and his jaw dropped now mrs f i do call that ajumpin to conclusions he said presently quite testily for him you have nt no earthly reason for sayin sich a thing is it likely my nevvy ud go off to merica again when hes only just acomed back did nt he say he was alongin and alongin to be back to the old country i know interrupted rosali,0
e quickly but for all that im sure he means to return to america now he told me he landed at liverpool and depend upon it he intends to start from there again yes yes im quite sure of it he did not rest you see until he had put the length of the country between us and now he means to go further stillperhaps when he is at the other side of the world he will be contented she spoke with irrepressible bitterness but isaac did not notice it if thats your opinion mrs f he said we d best lose no time in carryin out my little plan i ve got a plan d ye see he added with modest triumph ah it comed to me all of a sudden well write to him mrs f but what would be the use of writing said rosalie we cannot force him to come back against his will nay we cant force him but i think t is only some notion the chaps got in his head he seemed quite settled till last week and maybe the rovin fit will ha wore off a bit by now hes gone all the way to liver,0
pool d ye seethat ought to ha let off a bit o steam maybe if we wrote him a letter and just axed him straight out he might change his mind we can send a letter with his luggaget wont be too late so long as he has nt left the country and he cant leave the country wiout his luggage d ye see we can but try of courseyou can try said rosalie pressing her hand to her head with a bewildered air so i were thinkin mrs f if ye d jist set down and drop a line to en for methats to say if your head baint atroublin you too much he was looking at her pleadingly misunderstanding the expression of her face oh never mind about my head im only wonderingim only thinking must the letter go today well ye see richard did ax most perticlar for his traps to be sent off at once replied the farmer his eyes round with anxiety and if we dont send the letter at the same time we mid miss him bithey used always to write to him for you didnt she said rosalie ca,0
tching at the last straw perhaps it would have more effect if she wrote nay now my dear if ye d be so obligin i d take it very kind o you to do it it d take bithey very near three days to write a letteri d be very much obliged to ee my dear he repeated persuasively thus adjured she had no resource but to comply and with a beating heart and throbbing brain she set about her preparations going to the window she drew up the blind a little way and then collecting pen ink and paper sat down opposite isaac at the table when she had thus inaugurated proceedings isaac might have been observed to gather himself up concentrating as it were all his forces in preparation to the effort of composition having dipped her pen in the ink rosalie looked inquiringly at him how do you wish me to begin she said bithey do alays start off wi my dear nevvy responded isaac in a husky tone as though he were speaking from beneath a blanket which evidently resulted from the mighty,0
constraint he was putting upon himself my dear nephew wrote rosalie and then she raised her eyes again the farmer cleared his throat drew a long breath and continued slowly and with apparently immense difficulty your uncle isaac do say say repeated rosalie when she had written the last word isaac crimson in the face was absorbed in the mental struggle but presently perceived with a start that her pen had stopped moving have ee got say well your uncle isaac do sayas i hope youll change your mind had nt i better put he hopes said the secretary the farmer came out of his brown study and looked up at her inquiringly whos he why you of course if i say your uncle isaac i ought to go on in the same way he says if i say i it will look as if i were speaking of myselfas if it were i who wished he would change his mind well and dont ee wish it asked isaac sharply but reproachfully too rosalie bent her head over the paper and,0
answered hurriedly i oh of course of course but it would not do for me to tell him soit would be too much of a liberty lard no my dear richard would nt think it such but there i be dathered with so much talkyou must nt cut in again mrs ft is terrible hard work writin letters and if ye go for to speak to i in the middle ill be all mixed up let me tell ee my own way d ye seerichard knows my ways and hell understand fast enough now let me seeyour uncle isaac wishes for to say as i hope yell change your mind and come back mrs f is awritin this for i and she wishes for to say t is uncle isaac as wants ee backthatll make it all right d ye see he continued dropping the high unnatural tone which seemed essential to dictation and adopting a confidential onenow he cant go for to make no mistakes have ee wrote that nooh dont make me write that mr sharpei dont want him to think me unkind isaac clicked his tongue in desperation,0
lard ha mercy he ejaculated this here letter ull never get wrote now my dear jist put down what i d tell eeand dont flurry me when i do get flurried i cant for the life o me think o nothin jist be aputtin o that down and ill go on thinkin d ye see itll come rightyell find itll come right rosalie reluctantly set down the required sentence and found at its conclusion that isaac had already inflated himself in preparation for a further effort mrs f d wish ee to come back too as is natral but she thinks it more becomin not to say so he fixed his eyes sternly upon her as he enunciated this statement and in sheer desperation rosalie set it down now ye have nt nothing to complain of i dont think he remarked triumphantly now we can get on wellwhat next after deep reflection the following words came forth t is most onconvenient for ee to be aleavin me at such short notice iwisheemostperticlartocomebacktow,0
eek we be a goin to cut the church meadow and every hand be wanted i do feel a bit hurt in my feelinshere isaac paused to brush his coat sleeve across his eyes and continued brokenlyhurt in my feelins to think as you have aleft your old uncle like that t war nt well done o him he muttered parenthetically nay i cant say as it were well done o richard he wiped his eyes again sniffed drew an immense breath and started off afresh like that i do think ye mid ha said a word but i will not find fault no more but jist ax ye to come straight backan all will be forgive and forgot now i think mrs f we mid finish ye mid jist write my name and ill put my mark to it he heaved a deep sigh of relief wiped his brow and sat gazing at her as she appended his signature to the page that be my name be it he inquired it do look very pretty wrote out so nice and small ees i can see as this heres my name isa you put a twice mrs,0
f yes it should be written twice ah said the farmer gazing at the page doubtfully bithey now do only put it onceit be a matter o taste i suppose well now ill put my mark he ground his pen slowly into the paper horizontally and perpendicularly and remained gazing at it with a certain modest pride there shut en up now and write his name outside rosalie obeyed and held out the document towards isaac but as he was about to take it she drew it back a deep flush overspreading her face after a moments hesitation however she again tendered it to him theretake it she said with a note of sharpness in her voice which would have struck a more acute observer than isaac but he duly pocketed it without noticing that anything was amiss left to herself she sat for a moment or two in deep thought her chin propped upon her hands then suddenly rising rushed out into the yard mr sharpe she called isaac but the farmers broad back was already vanishing down the l,0
ane evidently her voice failed to reach him as he did not turn his head rosalie stood looking after him without making further attempts to attract his attention and then slowly returned to the house why should she call him back after allwhat need was there for her thus to disturb herself could she help writing the letter exactly as he wished and how foolish were the qualms of conscience which the remembrance of certain phrases in it evoked it was his letter not hers it was he who had insisted on stating that she wished richard to returnshe had never authorised him to do so if richard did come back she could not be blamed for it if he did come back again supporting her throbbing head with her hands she tried to reason with herself but the turmoil in heart and brain for a time forbade any consecutive train of ideas during the long blank days which had passed since richards departure and often in the course of the weary restless nights this thought had constantly recurred to her wit,0
h a neverfailing stabhe has gonehe will never come back and now if he did come backif he came back even for a little while if she might just see him again if it were only to be once or twice at the mere suggestion she was conscious of a lifting of the load which had been crushing her if he were made to know through no fault of hers but rather against her will that she did wish him to returnshe who had let him go forth without a word to stay himif he even guessed that she longed to see himoh it would be sweet to think he knew that he would henceforth judge her less harshly that he would realise how hard had been her struggle she raised her head her lips parted in a smile her eyes dreamily gazing at the strip of sunlit green outside her window there he had stood thence he had turned away so mournfully and now he was to come back to come back would he not read between the lines of the oddly composed missivewould not the very words have for him a deeper meaning than their,0
guileless originator guessed atwould he not come flying to her side in a few daysin little more than a few hours perhaps he would be with her and then she gave a sudden gasp and flung herself forward across the table and then in a moment the web of selfdeception with which she had been endeavouring to cloak the situation was torn to shreds and she saw the truth a crisis was impending it was folly to pretend that it would take her unawares it was worse than folly to endeavour to shift the responsibility to poor unsuspicious isaac if richard returned the struggle would have to be gone through again it would be even harder than before for she would have lured him back after he had broken from her if thus sorely tempted and wrongfully encouraged he were to speak those words which she had seen so often trembling on his lips what answer could she make could she look him in the face and affect unconsciousness orwhat did she mean to do did she mean to keep her plighted troth as an hon,0
est woman should or did she mean to cast aside for good and all truth and honour and selfrespect and jilt the man who had been her faithful friend i want to do right said rosalie with another gasping sigh i have never told a lie in my life i wont tell one now i wont act one either if he comes back it will only be on false pretences he must nt be allowed to come back she lay still for a moment her arms extended a kind of tremor passing every now and then over her frame presently she said again half aloud i wont be deceitful i wont break my word but oh how hard it is to do right god help me she straightened herself all at once and pushed back the hair from her forehead then drawing the blotter towards her wrote a hasty line on a sheet of paperdo not come back i implore you r fthrust it into an envelope and directed it to richard with little convulsive sobs at intervals she went upstairs bathed her swollen eyes and put on her hat there was no one a,0

could not be expected to last towards evening on the second day farmer sharpe stood alone in the centre of the field mopped for the hundredth time his perspiring brow and cast a contemplative look round t was past seven oclock the men had gone home some time before but he had remained to take a final survey of the scene of their labours i dont think its so very like to rain remarked isaac looking up at the sky where indeed no trace of a cloud was to be seen nay i dont hold wi jobt will keep up for a bit yet mrs f ull ha gone home by now i should thinkshed begin to find it a bit damp in the dell the dew be falling very fast well ill go home to my supper he passed through the gate at the further end of the field and had traversed more than half the distance which separated him from his home when the sound of heavy but rapid steps behind him made him halt and turn round job hunt who had evidently been hastening in pursuit of him paused too his great red fa,0
ce wearing an appearance of unusual excitement and his sly blue eyes positively goggling in his head owing to the unusual press of work and the need for accomplishing it in a given time isaac had persuaded rosalie to consent to his engaging this unwelcome addition to her forces and she had agreed with a meekness that sufficiently indicated her spiritless condition job it was who had been most energetic in foretelling a coming storm partly in order to render his services the more valuable and partly because of a natural pleasure in predicting disaster to mrs fianders crops well said isaac gazing at him in astonishment have ee seen what be goin on yonder sir was jobs counterquery what be agoin on where inquired the farmer why there returned hunt with a significant jerk of the thumb in the direction of the church meadow there baint nothin at all agoin on there returned his employer sternly i be just come from therethe fields empty nay mr sharpe retu,0

ssed before isaac sharpe looking down through the willowbushes descried richard marshall in such close proximity to mrs fiander nothing certainly was farther from rosalies thoughts when she had taken refuge in that sheltered spot from the glare of the afternoon sun than the expectation of the advent of this companion she had in fact quite decided that he was by this time out of the country and had indeed made up her mind to erase his image definitely from her memory henceforward as she frequently told herself she must think only of isaacisaac who had always been her friend who was so soon to be her husband her husbandshe must face the thought though she unconsciously shrank from it oh wouldwould that this sweet cup of forbidden love had never been held to her lips she had dashed it from her but the taste of it remained and had taken all the savour out of her life it had been to her a poisonous cup containing as it did wine from the fruit of the tree of knowledge you know,0
very little of life richard had said to her once alas alas she knew now more than enough oh eliaspoor elias she groaned to herself sometimes why did you die if you had lived i should have known nothingi should have guessed at nothing i might have gone down to my grave without knowing that there was any other love besides that which i gave you as an antidote to the rebellious longing of which she was too often conscious rosalie had recourse to the panacea she had hitherto found unfailing in times of affliction hard work since the writing of that letter to richard and the subsequent battle with herself she had resumed her old energetic habits once more she rose with the dawn once more she passed hours in toil no less arduous than that allotted to her servants she avoided solitude as much as possible and strove by every means in her power to tire herself out so tired was she indeed on this particular afternoon that having sought the friendly shade of the grassy nook alre,0
ady referred to she acknowledged herself to be incapable of further effort even when the great heat had somewhat abated and the retreating voices and heavy tread of her labourers as they trooped homewards warned her that it was growing late she sat on her hands clasping her knees her eyes gazing vacantly on the ground too weary even to think a footstep sounded in the neighbourhood of her retreat but she did not raise her eyes it was some straggler probably hastening to rejoin the others she could hear the bushes rustling as though brushed by a passing form and kept very still she wanted nobody to speak to her nobody even to look at her but now the step faltered haltedthere was a pause and then rapid feet began to descend towards where she sat she raised her eyes first in surprise and a little irritation then in incredulous wonder thenoh what was it that richard saw in them in a moment he was bending over her and both her hands were clasped in his was it that particular mome,0

icable triumpha triumph that was almost fierce you belong to me he said and his words were perhaps the more passionate because spoken so low you have belonged to me from the first even from the moment when i saw you in the picture i said to myself oh no pleaded rosalie in tones as passionate as his but infinitely piteous do not say it richarddo notdo not put it into words her hand flew out involuntarily as though to stop his mouth he caught it and kissed it though it fluttered in his grasp why should i not say itwhy should i not be brave enough to put into words the thought which has been in both our minds so often when i saw your picture i fancied myself standing beside you bending over you oh hush hush she had withdrawn her hand and was covering her face i said to myself he persevered his words coming brokenly because of his quick breathing i said to myself if that woman lives she shall be my wifei will search for her until i find her and then w,0

vering lips the veins on his forehead stood out there was no mistaking the bitter contempt with which he stigmatised his own conduct but there was even less possibility of misapprehending his deadly earnestness of purpose i mean to have you he went on i mean to let everything goexcept you she was so much taken aback at the suddenness of the onslaught so confounded at the quickness with which he had forestalled all she had intended to urge that she stood before him for a moment absolutely mute trembling moreover with the growing consciousness of her own weakness and at his confident assumption of mastery over her meanwhile he with his eyes fixed upon her face read it like a book his own suddenly changed it is useless to struggle love he said speaking very gently and tenderly we have both done our bestwe have tried to do right but fate has been too strong for us we must just make up our minds to let ourselves go with the tideand be happy rosalie was as has been seen,0
very impressionable very emotionalin a word very womanly but for all that there was at her hearts core the little kernel of strength which is to be found in the hearts of most good womenan instinctive sense of rectitude the love of duty for dutys sake even when the accomplishment of it involves great sacrifice she looked richard full in the face now no she said i will not take any happiness that has to be bought by doing wrong i made my own choice and fixed my lot in life before i knew you and now i will abide by it the very severity of the struggle gave her courage and richard all passionswayed as he was had in him a certain element of chivalrousness that responded to the effort she was making he was silent and rosalie quick to perceive her advantage went on eagerly i ask you to leave me richard i want you to go now it is quite true that you have a kind of power over me and that if youher voice faltered for a moment but she steadied itif you go on urging me and p,0
ersuading me you will very likely make me give in in the end but i ask you because you love me not to do this we could not be really happy ifif we came together through being dishonourable and ungrateful it is better to do right at all costs as for me i mean to keep my word to your uncle i will try my best to make him a good wife and to forget you and have you thought returned he with a bitterness which he could not controlhave you thought at all of what is to become of me the whole thing is absurd he went on with increasing irritation do you think for a moment that my uncle could suffer a tithe of what i shall suffer you know very well he is not capable of it besides he broke off i know what you mean said rosalie colouring faintly he would not have thought of marrying me if i had not first suggested it but i did suggest it and he is very fond of me now fond echoed the young man scornfully yes as fond as it is in his nature to be he has been faithfu,0

er xi picture music score from haydens surprise symphony when richard emerged from the shadowy hollow where he had left his mistress standing as if turned to stone he found all the land about him bathed with the rosy glow of sunset the long rollers of newlycut grass over which he stepped were touched here and there by arrows of light and the twigs of the hedge towards which he made his way were outlined as by fire he saw none of these things however but when climbing the low bank and passing through a gap in the hedge he descended into the road he was suddenly recalled to actualities by the unexpected appearance of a colossal figure which seemed to be mounting guard over his bicycle as richard started back farmer sharpe rose from his seat on the bank and stood square and determined before him the ruddy light playing upon his rugged face and shaggy hair and glorifying his white smock one great hand still rested on the saddle of the bicycle which it almost entirely covered,0
as richard remained dumbly gazing at him his fingers began to drum an impatient tune on its smooth surface the young man gazed desperately first at him and then at the bicycle filled with an insane desire to possess himself of it and ride away at full speed but whether because his courage failed him or because nobler and more manly feelings gained the ascendency over this momentary cowardice he did not put the design into execution after gazing steadily at his nephew for what seemed an interminable time isaac removed his hand from the bicycle and pointed in the direction of the little dell i seed ee there richard he remarked in a sepulchral tone i seed ee there with mrs f richard braced himself and looked him full in the face but made no rejoinder ees said the farmer i seed ye both and ive been awaiting here for ye richard still silence richard indeed felt that it would be useless to enter upon either explanation or apology mr sharpes hand crept back to the,0
saddle and resumed its impatient tune he planted his legs a little more widely apart continuing the while to stare unwinkingly in his nephews face when the tension had become almost unbearable he spoke again i thought i d wait for ee here he said i thought ye d very likely have summat to say to me the young man bit his lip and clenched his hands he could scarcely brook the expectant look in those eyes what am i to say uncle isaac iwhat can i say im going away at once the combined effect of sunshine and emotion had already intensified the farmers usually healthy colour but this announcement caused it to deepen to a positively alarming extent for a moment he seemed in danger of suffocation he raised his hand mechanically to the loose collar of his smock and clutched at it his eyes seemed ready to start from their sockets and though he opened his mouth and rolled his head from side to side as though about to fulminate against his nephew no words came dont cried r,0
ichard much alarmeddont be so angry uncleyou really need nt be so much upset i tell you im going away at oncetonight farmer sharpe sank down on the bank sliding his legs out before him rigid as a pair of compasses his head continued to roll threateningly and his eyes to gaze fiercely at richard but it was some time before he could find voice ye cant go tonight he said at last in husky suffocating tones there baint no train tonight not from branston i know but i mean to ride to wimborne and catch the night train there somehow this catching of the night train at wimborne seemed to be the culminating point of richards depravity isaac positively groaned aloud the fierceness went out of his eyes and to richards infinite distress they filled with tears what more can i do he faltered torn with remorse and grief as he bent over him i did nt think it of ee richardnay if anybody had told me ye d go for to do such a thing i would nt ha believed em to go,0
off wiout a word to ime as has been a father to eenay not so much as a word he paused choked with emotion and fell to wiping his eyes and shaking his head disconsolately while richard slowly straightening himself stood looking down at him when job hunt did call me and did pint out as you was standinyou and mrs fhand in hand both hands in both hands he added correcting himself i didnt let on to take no notice i did send job about his business and i did say to myself ill wait says i my nevvy ull tell me all about it jist now and i did go and sit me down here says i ill not interfere ill wait i says richard will out wi it all to ihell act straight i says hell tell me he spoke almost appealingly richards face which had turned from white to red was now white again i wanted to spare you uncle he murmured at last falteringly isaac groaned and shook his head then drawing a long breath and peering anxiously at his nephew he whisper,0
ed pleadingly what was you asayin to mrs f when you was aholdin of her hands richard oh groaned the other impatiently there are some things that cant be talked about i should nt have held her handsi scarcely knew that i was holding them what does it matter now we have said goodbye to each other for ever we have made up our minds never to see each other again isaacs jaw dropped he brought down his fist heavily on the bank beside him well he muttered under his breath im danged i cant get no satisfaction not a word you know enough said richard fiercely be content with what i tell youi will never darken your doors again isaac brought down his fist once more on the bank and then slowly hoisted himself on to his feet if ye have nt naught to say to i ive summat to say to you he announced speaking very slowly i baint agoin to let ee go off like that t is my way to be straightforard ill speak my mind plain to ee this night and ill s,0
peak my mind to mrs f where be mrs f come along of i richard and find her he had squeezed through the gap in the hedge while still speaking and richard had no choice but to follow him a few strides brought them to the dell and looking down they descried rosalie standing in the same attitude as that in which richard had left her mrs fiander called isaac bending over the brink will ee oblige me by stepping up here the sides be a bit steep and i baint so young as i werei cant very well go down but i d be obliged if you d step up i ve summat to say to you and my nevvy here rosalie had started violently at the sound of his voice and now obeyed his summons in silence but she trembled so much and the wet grass had become so slippery that she stumbled often and it was some time before she completed the ascent meanwhile both men stood watching her motionless and in silence once or twice she had raised her eyes towards the great white figure which awaited her on the b,0
rink and it seemed to her that isaacs face was grave and stern like the face of a judge she did not dare once glance at richard but she felt even without looking at him that their secret was discovered the farmer backed a little away from the edge of the dell when rosalie came forth and stood looking from one to the other then he spoke very solemnly and with some hesitation mrs fiander as i was asayin to richard jist now t is best to be straightforardees t is best to speak out even when it be hard to speak out i cant get no satisfaction from richardhe did acshally tell i to my face as he had made up his mind to go straight off wiout a single word to i he comes wiout a word and he goes wiout a word now mrs f i did see you together jist now and i did think as you d have summat to tell me there was a long pause isaac looked once more from rosalies graceful shrinking figure to the other culprit who stood with bent head awaiting the storm of reproach and vitupera,0

reminded how guileless he had been how unsuspicious how chivalrous in thought and deed ees went on isaac i did leave ye to yourselvesi did ax ye to make friends do you mind how often i axed ye to be friends true indeed only too true they had taken a base advantage of his confidence they had profited of the opportunities he had given them only to be more and more unfaithful to him in their hearts i thought you d be different to what you do be he continued with increasing severity when samel cross did tell i as you d snap up mrs f richard what did i say says i my nevvy baint a snapper d ye mind i said the same thing to you well i thought maybe you d say summat thenbut not a word uncle iit is nt fair to reproach me like this i kept away from littlecomb as long as i could you know that ees i do know it richardi know it very well you would nt come with me when i did ax ee that sunday you would nt come along o me to littlecomb nay but you,0

o consideration for me i think ye knowed both on ye as materimony would nt come easy to i and seein as you did tell me plain richard the very first night you come home as you was on the lookout for a wife why not mrs f so well as another it was rosalies turn to gasp now and her face bloomed like a rose in the evening light but neither she nor richard spoke both were so suddenly brought down from their heights of heroics that it was natural they should feel somewhat dizzy and confused im a man o my word said isaac and if ye have made up your mind and fixed your chice on i mrs f whydrawing a deep breathill keep my promise my dear but if richard ud do so well as me t ud be a deal more convenient d ye see it ud seem a bit queer to change my state at my time o life and to leave the old home where i was born and bred and richard he has a very good notion o farmin and he d be willing to carry on the work in the old way and to take advice from i d ye se,0
e ah the notion did come to i soon arter he comed here thinks i to myself i wonder if richard ud dot ud be a deal more suitable thinks i and more satisfactory to all parties here isaac was interrupted by a sudden burst of laughter from his nephewlaughter which was indeed the outlet of such an extraordinary mixture of emotions that they had nearly found vent in tears the exquisite sense of relief the unhopedfor joy stirred his very hearts depths but on the other hand the humour of the situation struck him with almost equal force after the overwhelming remorse the bitter sense of shame which but a few moments ago had tortured them to discover that their contemplated sacrifice had very nearly set at naught good old isaacs dearest wish oh uncle uncle he cried as soon as the first ecstatic outburst of mirth had subsided why did you not speak before t would nt ha been very becomin for me to speak returned the farmer still with great dignity i knowed my dooty to mr,0
